# Session Handoff — AloParticleEditor / LT-4 ([MT-11] Phase 3 Stages 0+1+2 shipped, Stage 3 next)

**Last updated:** 2026-05-22 (post-Stage-2-bit-exact-verified). Phase 3 Stages 0 (spike + GO decision), 1 (D3D9Ex migration on real engine), and 2 (shared-handle texture infrastructure + bit-exact verification) all shipped + pushed to `origin/lt-4` at **`e5f3a40`**. Stage 3 is **WebView2 composition hosting migration** — the highest-risk stage of the entire plan and the documented FD6 failure point (three prior attempts produced opaque white despite clean API logs). Estimated 5-7 days extended for rigorous a11y testing.

**Test counts at handoff:** vitest **335 / 335** · Playwright native **96 / 96** (was 90 baseline; +6 D3D9Ex regression specs in [`tests/d3d9ex.spec.ts`](../web/apps/editor/tests/d3d9ex.spec.ts)) · MSBuild Debug + Release x64 clean (preexisting LIBCMTD warning) · tsc -b 0 errors · `shared_texture_test.exe` PASS at 5 (resolution × color) combinations including 3440×1440.

**Repo state at handoff:**

| | |
|---|---|
| **`origin/lt-4` HEAD** | `e5f3a40` (Stage 2 shared-handle infrastructure) |
| **Session branch** | `claude/keen-perlman-619e2c` at the same HEAD (FF'd in this dispatch) |
| **Working tree** | clean |
| **Phase 2 status** | Shipped at `4896aa7` behind `ALO_VIEWPORT_TRANSPORT=canvas-jpeg`. Default new-UI uses arch-A (visible popup with AlphaCompositor + UpdateLayeredWindow). |
| **Phase 3 status** | Stages 0, 1, 2 shipped. Stage 3 (composition hosting) is next, gated on user OK + a fresh sub-plan. |

## Next dispatch — [MT-11] Phase 3 Stage 3 (WebView2 composition hosting migration)

**Per [`tasks/todo.md`](todo.md) §4 Stage 3 + §6 Stage 3 acceptance.** This is the LOAD-BEARING risk of the entire plan — FD6 v1/v2/v3 each attempted variants of this transition and produced opaque-white output. The Stage 0 spike proved the composition path works on the user's RTX 3080, but the production-code migration is substantially larger than the spike.

**In scope:**
- Swap `CreateCoreWebView2Controller(hwnd, …)` → `CreateCoreWebView2CompositionController(hwnd, …)` in `src/host/HostWindow.cpp:InitWebView2` (around line 692).
- Stand up a `host::Compositor` class (new) owning the DComp device + target + visual tree. Reference pattern in the working `dxgi_spike.cpp` at `src/host/spike/`.
- Wire WebView2's `RootVisualTarget` to a DComp visual.
- Input routing rework: under composition hosting, host HWND receives input directly. Phase 2's `viewport/input` bridge surface keeps the renderer-routed keyboard path; mouse may shift to host WNDPROC + `ICoreWebView2CompositionController::SendMouseInput` forwarding (see todo.md §3.4).
- Cursor sync via `add_CursorChanged` + `WM_SETCURSOR`.
- DPI handling via `put_RasterizationScale`.
- Gate behind a new env var (e.g. `ALO_WEBVIEW2_HOSTING=composition`) so default still uses HWND-mode hosting and the existing 96-test harness can A/B.

**Acceptance gates (todo.md §6 Stage 3):**
- All 96 Playwright tests pass under visual hosting (gated by env var for A/B). CRITICAL — FD6 failure point.
- New `tests/composition-hosting.spec.ts`: assert clicks/keys reach renderer with identical coords/values as HWND mode.
- **Rigorous a11y suite** (per user direction): Narrator drives UI Automation; verifies menubar, tree rows, dialog modals, form-field labels. Compare against a golden file with minor-wording tolerance.
- A11y manual smoke: Narrator reads chrome, tab cycles, F2 inline rename, Escape closes modal/menu.
- IME composition under visual hosting (manual; irreducible).
- Keyboard nav stress: 100 random tabs / arrow keys / accelerators; no crash, focus always visible.

**Risk mitigation (FD6 lessons applied):**
- Bisect harness in `dxgi_spike.cpp` (`--no-engine` / `--no-webview2`) proved its weight in Stage 0 by catching the DComp z-order gotcha — keep that diagnostic mode available.
- Defer `CreateTargetForHwnd` + visual-tree construction until INSIDE the composition-controller completion callback (FD6 v3 attributed at least part of the failure to early tree construction).
- Don't claim "works" from clean API logs alone. FD6 v1-v3 all returned `S_OK` everywhere with opaque-white output. **Visual confirmation via screenshot is mandatory.**

```

### Stage 0 — Spike + GO decision

- [docs/superpowers/research/dxgi-fd6-fd9-history.md](../docs/superpowers/research/dxgi-fd6-fd9-history.md) — post-mortem of FD6 v1/v2/v3 + FD7 + FD8/FD9. Identifies the architectural distinction (Phase 3 has both engine + WebView2 as DComp visuals, vs FD6's mixed paradigm) and the FD6 failure mode (clean S_OK + opaque white).
- [docs/superpowers/research/dxgi-stage-0-decision.md](../docs/superpowers/research/dxgi-stage-0-decision.md) — locked GO criteria + per-resolution measurements (3000+ FPS at all 4 resolutions on RTX 3080; transport latency 0.30-0.34 ms across 720p/1080p/1440p/3440×1440).
- [docs/superpowers/research/dxgi-stage-0-run-procedure.md](../docs/superpowers/research/dxgi-stage-0-run-procedure.md) — how to run the spike + interpret results.
- [src/host/spike/dxgi_spike.cpp](../src/host/spike/dxgi_spike.cpp) — standalone exe (~590 LOC) proving D3D9Ex shared handle → D3D11 → DComp + WebView2 composition controller pipeline end-to-end. **Bisect modes (`--no-engine`, `--no-webview2`) caught the DComp `insertAbove` z-order bug** — keep this harness alive for Stage 3.
- Screenshots at [docs/superpowers/research/spike-screenshots/](../docs/superpowers/research/spike-screenshots/) — 720p/1080p/1440p/3440x1440 PNGs, all showing correct composite.

### Stage 1 — D3D9Ex migration on production engine

- [src/engine.h](../src/engine.h) — `m_pDirect3D` / `m_pDevice` types promoted to `IDirect3D9Ex*` / `IDirect3DDevice9Ex*` (covariant; existing call sites compile unchanged).
- [src/engine.cpp](../src/engine.cpp) — `Direct3DCreate9` → `Direct3DCreate9Ex`, `CreateDevice` → `CreateDeviceEx` + `D3DCREATE_MULTITHREADED` flag. **Hard-fail on D3D9Ex unavailable** (per dispatch decision #1; production fallback is legacy arch-A at Stage 6+, not silent D3D9 downgrade).
- Four D3DPOOL_MANAGED migrations to D3DPOOL_DEFAULT (engine.cpp:1044 ground solid-colour helper, 1511/1522 skydome VB/IB, 1608 custom skydome texture). All wired into `Engine::Reset` via new `CreateSkydomeMeshBuffers` / `ReleaseSkydomeMeshBuffers` helpers + `ReloadGroundTexture` / `ReloadSkydomeTexture` post-Reset re-invokes.
- New `Engine::GetSharedTextureHandle()` (Stage 2b portion, but committed together).
- [web/apps/editor/tests/d3d9ex.spec.ts](../web/apps/editor/tests/d3d9ex.spec.ts) — 6 new Playwright specs: bridge-attached smoke, ground cycle (L-007 regression), solid-colour ground (slot 4), skydome cycle, **10× resize cycle (Engine::Reset stress)**, L-007 polluter pair + ground set.

### Stage 2 — Shared-handle texture infrastructure

- [src/host/AlphaCompositor.cpp](../src/host/AlphaCompositor.cpp) — `offscreenRT` promoted from `CreateRenderTarget` to `CreateTexture(USAGE_RENDERTARGET, D3DPOOL_DEFAULT, &sharedHandle)`. The level-0 surface is still used as the engine's render target; arch-A behavior unchanged. New `AlphaCompositor::GetSharedHandle()` exposes the NT-handle alias.
- [src/engine.cpp](../src/engine.cpp) — `Engine::GetSharedTextureHandle()` forwards to the compositor's handle (returns nullptr when compositor not installed, e.g. canvas-jpeg mode).
- [src/host/spike/shared_texture_test.cpp](../src/host/spike/shared_texture_test.cpp) — new standalone CLI exe (~260 LOC). Creates D3D9Ex device, shared-handle texture, Clears to known color, opens in D3D11 via `OpenSharedResource`, CopyResource → staging → Map → byte-compare every pixel. Exit 0/1/2 for PASS/FAIL/init-error. **Five PASS runs verified on user's RTX 3080**: 256×256 / 3440×1440 / 1920×1080 (alpha=0) / 1280×720 / 3440×1440-Release with various colors.

### Perf investigation findings (user-asked mid-dispatch)

User reported ~40 FPS at maximized 3440×1440. Investigation via temporary `[Perf]` instrumentation in `AlphaCompositor::Composite` (reverted before commit) measured:

- `readback` (GetRenderTargetData submit): ~0.00 ms (async).
- `dibCopy` (LockRect + memcpy SYSTEMMEM→DIB): **~12 ms** ← dominant; LockRect blocks for the GPU readback.
- `cacheCopy` (DIB → lastRawDib for modal snapshot cache): ~2-5 ms ← wasted on 99.9% of frames.
- `stamps` (band + occlusion alpha): ~1 ms.
- `ulw` (UpdateLayeredWindow): ~3.5 ms.
- TOTAL: ~19 ms → ~50 FPS at maximize.

**Stage 1 was ruled OUT as the cause** — D3DCREATE_MULTITHREADED adds sub-microsecond mutex on ~3 D3D calls per frame. The 40-50 FPS matches the documented FD9 baseline ([dxgi-fd6-fd9-history.md §5](../docs/superpowers/research/dxgi-fd6-fd9-history.md#5-fd8--fd9--the-path-that-shipped)). The proper fix is Phase 3 Stage 4 (shared-handle GPU→GPU eliminates the readback path entirely; spike measured 0.30 ms total at 3440×1440 vs current 19 ms).

The `cacheCopy` is genuinely wasted work — **spawned as a separate task** for a future dispatch (~15% FPS gain, ~1-2 hour fix; user chose "do it as a separate dispatch"). See the chip for `Defer lastRawDib cache copy (~15% FPS at maximize)`.

## Critical references for Stage 3

In priority order:

1. **[docs/superpowers/research/dxgi-fd6-fd9-history.md](../docs/superpowers/research/dxgi-fd6-fd9-history.md)** — must read end-to-end before any composition-hosting code is written. §1-3 cover FD6 v1/v2/v3 failure modes; §9 has the concrete "lessons for the spike" that apply equally to Stage 3 production code (defer tree construction until controller exists, instrument every API for non-S_OK, screenshot before declaring success, mirror sample topology).
2. **[src/host/spike/dxgi_spike.cpp](../src/host/spike/dxgi_spike.cpp)** — working reference. Particularly: `OnCompositionControllerReady` callback structure, `BuildVisualTree` deferred-construction pattern, DComp `AddVisual` z-order gotcha (insertAbove=FALSE with NULL ref = "in front of all siblings"). The bisect modes (`--no-engine`, `--no-webview2`) paid for themselves in Stage 0; Stage 3 should have analogous diagnostic env vars.
3. **[tasks/lt4_phase_4_1_fd6_visual_hosting_plan.md](lt4_phase_4_1_fd6_visual_hosting_plan.md)** — the original FD6 plan with all three attempts' postmortems inline. Background reading.
4. **[tasks/todo.md](todo.md) §4 Stage 3 + §6 Stage 3 acceptance** — the active sub-plan headers. The new dispatch writes its own CLAUDE.md-shaped sub-plan before coding.
5. **[tasks/lessons.md](lessons.md) L-003** — postMessage drops under CDP attach; the test-host bridge uses host-object channel to work around this. Stage 3's composition-mode WebView2 may interact differently with CDP — explicitly verify before declaring tests pass.
6. **[web/apps/editor/scripts/run-native-tests.mjs](../web/apps/editor/scripts/run-native-tests.mjs)** — harness for the 96-test native CDP suite. Stage 3 must keep all 96 green under the new hosting mode.

## Resumable state (snapshot)

| Thing | Value |
|---|---|
| **Worktree** | `C:\Modding\Particle Editor\.claude\worktrees\keen-perlman-619e2c` (this dispatch's; next session gets a fresh `claude/<random>` from `origin/lt-4`) |
| **HEAD (committed)** | `e5f3a40` (Stage 2 — shared-handle infrastructure) |
| **Ahead of origin/lt-4** | 0 (FF'd) |
| **Behind master** | `lt-4` is many commits ahead of `master`; nothing merged to master from Phase 3 work yet, per user direction. |
| **Open PRs** | none |
| **Build status** | All targets clean: ParticleEditor, expatw_static, viewport_poc, dxgi_spike, shared_texture_test (Debug + Release x64). |
| **Phase status** | Phase 3 Stages 0, 1, 2 shipped behind no env-var (Stage 1 changes are always-on D3D9Ex; Stage 2's shared-handle promotion of AlphaCompositor RT is also always-on — verified by 96/96 Playwright pass). Stage 3 introduces the first env-var-gated change in Phase 3. |

## Phase 2 smoke matrix — reference if smoke surfaces a regression

Phase 2 was user-verified working before commit. Reference matrix for diagnostic / regression-test purposes:

**Launch (PowerShell):**

```powershell
$env:VITE_VIEWPORT_TRANSPORT = "canvas-jpeg"
cd web/apps/editor; pnpm run build; cd ../../..
$env:ALO_VIEWPORT_TRANSPORT = "canvas-jpeg"
./x64/Debug/ParticleEditor.exe --new-ui
```

Or two-terminal dev mode (Vite HMR):

```powershell
cd web/apps/editor
$env:VITE_VIEWPORT_TRANSPORT = "canvas-jpeg"
pnpm run build
$env:ALO_VIEWPORT_TRANSPORT = "canvas-jpeg"
./x64/Debug/ParticleEditor.exe
```

**The matrix.**

| Gesture | Expected | Verifies |
|---|---|---|
| LMB-drag in viewport | Camera MOVE (target translates) | mousedown/move/up + MK_LBUTTON encoded |
| RMB-drag in viewport | Camera ROTATE (orbit around target) | RMB encoding + drag continuity past canvas edge |
| MMB-drag | Camera MOVE | MMB encoding |
| Ctrl+LMB-drag | ZOOM | MK_CONTROL bit reassembled per event |
| Ctrl+RMB-drag | ZOOM | as above |
| Wheel up | Zoom in | deltaY sign convention correct |
| Wheel down | Zoom out | as above |
| Shift+LMB-click | Cursor-bound instance spawns | MK_SHIFT on mousedown + VK_SHIFT keydown reaches host |
| Release Shift | Instance dies | VK_SHIFT keyup |
| Alt-Tab while holding Shift | Instance dies (defensive) | window.blur → WM_KILLFOCUS path |
| Open File menu while canvas active | No cutout artifact in the dropdown | popup hidden, canvas is the only visible viewport |
| Open Mods → submenu with chrome | No cutout artifact | **the headline payoff** |
| Open a modal (Help → About) | Frosted-glass backdrop unchanged | snapshot-into-DOM path still works alongside archC |

**Diagnostics.** In archC mode the host logs `[ArchC] InputDispatcher up (popup=...)` + `[ArchC] viewport popup hidden (canvas-in-DOM is the visible surface)` lines on startup. Diagnostic logging from this session (`[ArchC-input]` per-event, `[ArchC-engine]` per-LBUTTONDOWN, `[ArchC-kill]` per-attached-instance kill, `[ArchC] frame=N` at 1 Hz) is retained in the code as a Stage-4/5 regression detection aid — slated for removal in Phase 3 Stage 7 per the [`tasks/todo.md`](todo.md) cleanup plan.

## Alternative next-dispatch options (if not starting DXGI)

Below in priority order if the user chooses to defer Stage 0. The primary recommendation remains Stage 0.

| Option | Why next | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| **B2 obsolescence audit** | Older HANDOFF §0b suspected B1.3 already absorbed B2's scope; a quick diff probably retires B2 entirely | ~30 min |
| **MT-1 follow-up — texture-picker `…` buttons** | New-UI never wired the legacy `IDC_BUTTON1` / `IDC_BUTTON2` browse buttons; comment marker `TODO(MT-1)` in [EmitterPropertyTabs.tsx](../web/apps/editor/src/screens/EmitterPropertyTabs.tsx) | ~2-4 h |
| **[NT-5] Engine-side single-member link-group enforcement** | Top of Near-term (position 1.1). Data-layer parity with the B1 render-layer filter | small |
| **[NT-6] Visual-stability lane assignment** | Optional bracket-gutter ergonomic improvement (position 1.2) | small |

## What landed this session — [MT-11] Phase 2 close-out + DXGI plan

- **`viewport/input` bridge surface** — single kind with discriminated `ViewportInputEvent` union ([bridge-schema/src/index.ts](../web/packages/bridge-schema/src/index.ts) + MockBridge no-op arm).
- **Renderer encoders** — new [`web/apps/editor/src/lib/viewport-input.ts`](../web/apps/editor/src/lib/viewport-input.ts) with pure-function helpers (`encodeMkButtons`, `quantiseWheelDelta`, `toPopupClientCoords`, `isTypingTarget`, `makeMouseEvent` / `makeWheelEvent` / `makeKeyEvent`).
- **ViewportSlot DOM handlers** — third `useEffect` in [`ViewportSlot.tsx`](../web/apps/editor/src/components/ViewportSlot.tsx) wiring pointerdown/move/up/cancel + contextmenu + native `wheel` listener `{ passive: false }` on the canvas; window-scoped keydown / keyup / blur with TYPING_TAGS guard. `setPointerCapture` on pointerdown for drag continuity.
- **Host InputDispatcher** — new [`src/host/InputDispatcher.{h,cpp}`](../src/host/InputDispatcher.h) switches on payload type, decodes into `WM_*` / `wParam` / `lParam`, `PostMessage`s to the popup HWND. Wired through [`BridgeDispatcher`](../src/host/BridgeDispatcher.cpp) (`SetInputDispatcher` + `viewport/input` arm). Constructed in `WM_CREATE` alongside `FramePublisher` when `m_archCMode`; torn down before the compositor.
- **Popup hide** — `LayoutBroker::GetViewport()` + `HostWindowImpl::Run` calls `ShowWindow(SW_HIDE)` after `ApplyFullClient` when `m_archCMode`. Popup still spans full main client so `LayoutBroker` scene-rect math + D3D9 swapchain stay valid; `UpdateLayeredWindow` becomes a wasted no-op.
- **Shift+LMB regression fix** — `SetFocus(hwnd)` at the top of WM_LBUTTONDOWN was triggering a spurious `WM_KILLFOCUS` cascade on the hidden popup that killed cursor-bound spawns within ~2ms. Gated `SetFocus` (LMB + RMB) + the `WM_KILLFOCUS` defensive kill on `!m_archCMode` to break the focus-thrash → kill loop.
- **Legacy placement gesture preserved** — Added `OBJECT_Z` drag mode to `HostWindow.cpp` matching legacy `src/main.cpp:2877-2934`: WM_LBUTTONDOWN with attached preview enters OBJECT_Z (Z-axis drag, X/Y frozen), WM_MOUSEMOVE adjusts `cursor.z = -y * camDist / 1000`, WM_LBUTTONUP calls `engine->DetachParticleSystem(attached)`. The cursor-bound preview becomes a free-running placed system. User-verified: chain-clicks place multiple, Shift release ends gesture.
- **DXGI plan drafted** — [`tasks/todo.md`](todo.md) restructured as the Phase 3 DXGI plan; Phase 0+1+2 planning content moved to [`tasks/todo-mt-11-phase-0-1-2-archive.md`](todo-mt-11-phase-0-1-2-archive.md). Phase 3 was originally "A/B verification" (~2-4h) but redirected to "DXGI shared-handle compositing" (~5 weeks) after Phase 2 perf smoke showed canvas-JPEG bandwidth-bound at 20 FPS on maximized 3440×1440. Stage 0 of the new plan is a 2-day hard gate; NO-GO falls back to legacy arch-A.
- **Tests** — vitest +35 (26 encoder unit tests in new `viewport-input.test.ts`, 9 DOM-integration tests in `ViewportSlot.test.tsx`'s new Phase 2 describe block); new Playwright [`tests/canvas-architecture.spec.ts`](../web/apps/editor/tests/canvas-architecture.spec.ts) with 3 cases that self-skip in legacy CI.

Decisions captured for next session:

1. Single `viewport/input` kind with discriminator (vs per-event-type kinds) — matches Win32 MSG shape, one dispatch arm per side.
2. `SW_HIDE` only, popup stays sized to full main client (vs move off-screen) — preserves T4c.4 scene-rect math.
3. Include `window.blur` → `viewport/input { type: "blur" }` so cursor-bound spawn dies on Alt-Tab.
4. Forward all keys that pass TYPING_TAGS guard — engine wndproc default-cases unknowns, broad forward is safe + forward-compat.
5. Phase 3 = DXGI, not A/B verification. Fallback = legacy arch-A (not SharedBuffer, not canvas-JPEG).
6. Rigorous a11y testing in Stage 3 (per user direction).

The chrome-cutout artifact that motivated [MT-11] IS gone in Phase 2 (verified). The remaining gap is performance at maximized resolution — Phase 3 DXGI plan addresses that. See [`tasks/todo.md`](todo.md) for the active plan.

## What landed this session — [MT-11] Phase 0 + Phase 1 (one combined commit)

### Phase 0 — Spike
JPEG inline-in-payload transport chosen over WebResourceRequested mid-spike when **L-015** ([SetVirtualHostNameToFolderMapping short-circuits user `WebResourceRequested`](lessons.md#l-015)) surfaced. Spike numbers: **~120 FPS sustained** at 699×495 (centre-quadrant scene rect), JPEG ~58 KB / base64 ~78 KB per frame, 1:1 host:renderer with no dropping. Gate was ≥30 FPS — cleared by 4×.

### Phase 1 — Production-grade hookup
- **[`web/packages/bridge-schema/src/index.ts`](../web/packages/bridge-schema/src/index.ts)**: new `viewport/frame-ready` event kind, typed payload `{ w, h, frameId, jpegBase64 }`.
- **[`src/host/FramePublisher.h`](../src/host/FramePublisher.h)** + **[`.cpp`](../src/host/FramePublisher.cpp)**: new class owning the encode → base64 → emit → 1 Hz log-throttle pipeline. Constructed alongside `AlphaCompositor` in `WM_CREATE` when `ALO_VIEWPORT_TRANSPORT=canvas-jpeg`; torn down before the compositor in `WM_DESTROY`.
- **[`src/host/AlphaCompositor.h`](../src/host/AlphaCompositor.h)** + **[`.cpp`](../src/host/AlphaCompositor.cpp)**: new `EncodeFrameJpeg(quality, outBytes, w, h)` — GDI+ JPEG encode with scene-rect crop, same shape as the existing `CaptureSnapshotPng`.
- **[`src/host/HostWindow.cpp`](../src/host/HostWindow.cpp)**: env-var gate, `m_framePublisher` member, one-line `OnFrameComposited()` call per frame in `RenderD3D9`. Dead WebResourceRequested attempt deleted with a one-paragraph reference to L-015.
- **[`web/apps/editor/src/components/ViewportSlot.tsx`](../web/apps/editor/src/components/ViewportSlot.tsx)**: dual render path (legacy span vs `<canvas data-testid="viewport-canvas">`); typed `bridge.on("viewport/frame-ready", ...)`; `matchMedia('(resolution)')` listener for DPR-on-monitor-change; subscribe-before-context ordering so jsdom tests share the same code path.
- **[`web/apps/editor/src/components/__tests__/ViewportSlot.test.tsx`](../web/apps/editor/src/components/__tests__/ViewportSlot.test.tsx)**: new — +6 vitest tests covering both render paths + subscription lifecycle.

---

## Phase 2 — what's queued

The plan in [`tasks/todo.md` §6](todo.md) lays out Phase 2 (~4-6 h):

1. **`viewport/input` bridge surface** (schema + MockBridge cases) for mouse-down/up/move, wheel, keyboard.
2. **Renderer-side**: dispatch handlers on the `<canvas>` for mouse + wheel; window-scoped for keydown/up with `TYPING_TAGS` guard.
3. **Host-side `InputDispatcher.cpp`**: synthesize Win32 messages from bridge requests, post to the hidden popup HWND so the engine's existing input handlers consume them unchanged.
4. **Hide the popup HWND** (off-screen + `ShowWindow(SW_HIDE)`).
5. **Manual + Playwright smoke matrix**: LMB-drag rotate, MMB-drag pan, RMB-drag, wheel zoom, Shift+LMB instance spawn, keyboard hotkeys.

When Phase 2 ships, the canvas becomes the visible source of truth and the chrome-cutout artifact in dropdowns is gone permanently.

## What landed this session — B1.4 [NT-8] T0 → T4c.4 (11 commits, all ready for FF)

In execution order (oldest → newest):

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| [`302f942`](https://github.com/DrKnickers/new-particle-editor/commit/302f942) | **T1 — install `react-resizable-panels@4.11.1`.** Pre-flight via type declarations caught major API drift from the plan's 2.x sketch: `PanelGroup`→`Group`, `PanelResizeHandle`→`Separator`, `autoSaveId` removed (DIY `defaultLayout` + `onLayoutChanged`), double-click handle reset is now built-in. Plan §3 rewritten in place. T0 pre-flight audit (quadrant testIDs + getBoundingClientRect callsites) folded into the same commit. |
| [`56a1110`](https://github.com/DrKnickers/new-particle-editor/commit/56a1110) | **T2 — failing PanelLayout vitest skeleton.** Pins persistence-helper contract (`loadLayout`/`saveLayout` for corruption/missing-key/sum-drift cases) + the five quadrant testIDs + spawner mount/unmount under `useSpawnerVisible`. |
| [`ceab4f8`](https://github.com/DrKnickers/new-particle-editor/commit/ceab4f8) | **T3 — implement PanelLayout.** Three nested `<Group>`s (outer horizontal + left vertical + centre vertical). Per-Panel `defaultSize` derived from the loaded layout map. Persistence via `usePersistedLayout` (lazy `useMemo` load + `useCallback` write). |
| [`e3471bd`](https://github.com/DrKnickers/new-particle-editor/commit/e3471bd) | **T4 — wire PanelLayout into AppShell + 4.x sizing fix.** App.tsx swaps the main-row block for `<PanelLayout bridge={bridge} />`. Two 4.x quirks discovered mid-T4: numeric size props are PIXELS not percentages (use `${value}%` strings); `Group.defaultLayout` is effectively an SSR hint, `Panel.defaultSize` is the canonical client-mount knob. **L-014 captures both quirks** with cross-references to the exact lines of `react-resizable-panels.js` that drive the behaviour. |
| [`de83749`](https://github.com/DrKnickers/new-particle-editor/commit/de83749) | **T5 — Playwright splitter spec (+ 6 tests).** Drag-persistence, defaults, corrupted-localStorage fallback, spawner toggle 2col↔3col. `readLayout` helper derives orientation from computed flex-direction (4.x puts aria-orientation on `[data-separator]` only, not `[data-group]`). |
| [`be46d90`](https://github.com/DrKnickers/new-particle-editor/commit/be46d90) | **T4b — drag-flag popup-overlap fix (ABANDONED).** Tried to park the popup offscreen via `pointerdown` capture + restore on `pointerup`. Worked in vitest, failed in user smoke: popup stuck offscreen on some drags, popup at pre-drag rect on others (synchronous `pointerup` read of `getBoundingClientRect` happened before React committed the post-drag layout). Reverted at next commit. |
| [`0610f8f`](https://github.com/DrKnickers/new-particle-editor/commit/0610f8f) | **T4b revert.** Drag-flag approach abandoned in favour of the cleaner architectural fix below. |
| [`3caaf78`](https://github.com/DrKnickers/new-particle-editor/commit/3caaf78) | **T4c.1 — add `layout/scene-rect` to bridge schema.** Re-plan §7 documents the popup-spans-window architecture: popup HWND always sized to main client; the centre-quadrant rect drives an alpha-mask via `AlphaCompositor` so panels behind the popup's alpha-zero bands show through (and receive their own mouse events, courtesy of WS_EX_LAYERED+ULW_ALPHA hit-test semantics). Camera frustum stays at popup-rect aspect per user direction. |
| [`e115883`](https://github.com/DrKnickers/new-particle-editor/commit/e115883) | **T4c.2 — LayoutBroker scene-rect + AlphaCompositor band masks.** `LayoutBroker::SetSceneRect` translates main-client → popup-client and forwards to the compositor. `AlphaCompositor::Composite` stamps alpha=0 for the four outside-scene bands (top/bottom/left/right of the scene rect) AFTER the `lastRawDib` snapshot cache and BEFORE the per-id smoothstep occlusion pass. Hard cut, no smoothstep — band mask is the popup's parent chrome area where WebView paints whatever DOM is at those screen coords. |
| [`2dc147a`](https://github.com/DrKnickers/new-particle-editor/commit/2dc147a) | **T4c.3 — BridgeDispatcher `layout/scene-rect` handler.** Routes the message to `LayoutBroker::SetSceneRect`. No `Engine::Reset` involved (that's the load-bearing perf win — splitter drag fires per-frame `layout/scene-rect` without stacking expensive D3D9 device resets). |
| [`bd0fab2`](https://github.com/DrKnickers/new-particle-editor/commit/bd0fab2) | **T4c.4 — popup spans window, scene-rect drives mask.** ViewportSlot dispatches `layout/scene-rect` (replacing the previous `layout/viewport-rect`). New `LayoutBroker::ApplyFullClient` plus a one-shot call from `HostWindowImpl::Run` just before `ShowWindow` sizes the popup to the main HWND's full client rect at startup. Without this, the popup is stuck at CreateWindowExW's bootstrap rect (screen 16,16,320,240) and renders as a tiny preview at the monitor's top-left corner. Dialogs spec's rescale test reshaped into two tests: one for the DOM gesture (menu→modal→OK), one for the bridge contract (rescale-system → state/changed) — the previous form routed through React's NativeBridge → postMessage and was sensitive to per-T4c boot-time event volume (L-003 + the postMessage drop semantics under CDP). |
| [`ba8a3de`](https://github.com/DrKnickers/new-particle-editor/commit/ba8a3de) | **T4c.5 — Modal snapshot crops to scene rect.** `AlphaCompositor::CaptureSnapshotPng` now crops the cached BGRA buffer to (sceneX, sceneY, sceneW, sceneH) before PNG encode via the GDI+ subregion-view idiom (scan0 offset + parent stride; zero-copy). Falls back to the full DIB when no scene rect has been set (boot state, vitest harnesses that drive CaptureSnapshotPng without dispatching layout/scene-rect first). The Modal portal `<img>` continues to size to quadrant-viewport via CSS; only the PNG bytes change. Modal.test.tsx untouched — the contract is shape-only. |
| [`f3e2ea0`](https://github.com/DrKnickers/new-particle-editor/commit/f3e2ea0) | **T6 — Reset panel layout View-menu item.** New View → Reset panel layout menu item clears the four `alo:layout:*` keys and bumps an epoch counter passed as `key={n}` to `<PanelLayout />` so React remounts and the new mount's `loadLayout` calls read defaults. Exports `PANEL_LAYOUT_KEYS` + `resetPanelLayoutStorage` from PanelLayout (helper stays close to the persistence layer; unit test asserts key-set coverage to guard against drift). MenuBar threads `onResetPanelLayout` per existing `onOpen*` pattern. Vitest +4 (3 PanelLayout helpers + 1 MenuBar integration). Browser smoke verified end-to-end: seeded non-default splitter values, clicked the menu item, separators restored to in-code defaults with zero console errors. |
| **(T7)** | **Strip `[splitter]` dev breadcrumbs — no-op.** `git grep '[splitter]'` across web/ surfaced zero hits in source — only doc references in HANDOFF/todo.md. No commit. |
| `TODO-HASH` | **T8 — docs.** This dispatch's CHANGELOG entry (B1.4 [NT-8]); ROADMAP strikethrough + Shipped move + tag vacation for [NT-8] + new [MT-11] architecture-C migration entry at 2.1; tasks/HANDOFF refresh for next session; tasks/todo.md review section appended. |

## Open items — none

All four T4c-area close-out pieces shipped this session. The B1.4 [NT-8] arc is complete and ready for end-of-session FF + push to `origin/lt-4`. The next dispatch picks from the **Next dispatch options** table at the top of this file.

**Architecture observations carried forward (filed as ROADMAP [MT-11] + lessons.md L-014).**

1. **The user-visible cutout artifact under T4c is a hard limit of architecture A** (engine popup above WebView, alpha-cutout for HTML chrome). It's not a tuning problem; it's the cutout shape becoming visible. L-011 captures the rule; this session added *why* the rule has no clean workaround under T4c. [MT-11] (architecture C — canvas-in-DOM) is the migration path.
2. **Architecture B (FD6 DComp visual hosting) was attempted 3 times historically and abandoned.** Don't re-spike unless WebView2's DComp story changes. See [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-18-fd9-viewport-alpha-compositing.md:22`](../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-18-fd9-viewport-alpha-compositing.md:22).
3. **L-013's "Win32 drag-resize starves WebView2 IPC" extends to splitter drag inside WebView**, not just modal sizing loops. T4c sidesteps this by removing the popup-resize step from the splitter-drag path entirely (scene-rect is alpha-mask-only, no Engine::Reset).
4. **`react-resizable-panels@4.x` quirks** are now in lessons.md L-014: numeric `Panel.defaultSize` props are PIXELS not percentages (use `"NN%"` strings); `Group.defaultLayout` is effectively an SSR hint, `Panel.defaultSize` is the canonical client knob.

## Test counts + verification at handoff

- **Vitest:** 294 / 294 (was 281 baseline pre-B1.4; +9 PanelLayout from session 1, +4 T6 from this session).
- **Native Playwright:** 90 / 90 (was 83 baseline pre-B1.4; +6 from `tests/splitters.spec.ts`, +1 from the dialogs.spec.ts rescale split).
- **MSBuild Debug x64:** clean (preexisting LIBCMTD warning unchanged).
- **Manual smoke (T4c.4 build):** drag works smoothly across all four splitters; startup popup appears correctly inside the main window (no monitor-corner artifact); cutout artifact visible in chrome dropdowns (the architecture-A limit — [MT-11] migration path filed).
- **Browser smoke (T6, this session):** seeded non-default splitter values via `localStorage.setItem`, clicked View → Reset panel layout, verified separator aria-valuenow restored to in-code defaults (25/20/75/60), zero console errors.

## Read first

If you are a fresh Claude session resuming this project:

1. **This file** — top to bottom.
2. **[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)** — project conventions, plan structure, handoff discipline. The `## Branch workflow` section is load-bearing: `lt-4` is the integration branch; new sessions land on `claude/<random>` and FF into `lt-4` at session end.
3. **[CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md)** — the top entry (B1.4 resizable splitters) covers what just shipped; the B1.3.2 entry below covers the section-header unification + inspector polish; the B1.3.1.1 entry below covers the frosted-glass modal backdrop; entries further down (B1.3 tab parity, B1 left-pane realignment, Phase 2 redesign, Phase 1 tokens + theme) cover the architectural foundation.
4. **If picking up B1.3.1 / B1.4 / Phase 3** (most likely next step):
   - **[docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-20-b1-3-tab-parity.md](../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-20-b1-3-tab-parity.md)** — B1.3 spec (reference for B1.3.1's place in the sequence).
   - **[docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-19-particle-editor-2026-redesign.md](../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-19-particle-editor-2026-redesign.md)** — original full design spec.
   - **[docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-19-particle-editor-2026-redesign.md](../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-19-particle-editor-2026-redesign.md)** — step-by-step plan. **Phase 3 still references `tailwind.config.ts` in a few places — those need the same Tailwind v4 / `globals.css` translation Phase 1 got** (see the re-plan note at the top of Phase 1 for the pattern).
5. **[tasks/lessons.md](lessons.md)** — L-001 through L-014. **L-006 (don't clear React optimistic state on every host-data refresh) is load-bearing in `CurveEditorPanel.tsx`.** **L-010 (sweep BOTH vitest and Playwright on every label rename) applies to any future inspector field rename.** **L-011 + L-012 + L-013 are the load-bearing context for the new Modal architecture — read them before touching the snapshot-backdrop path or any other engine-popup-overlapping surface.** L-013 specifically: the Win32 modal sizing loop starves WebView2 IPC; design host-durable state for anything that must survive a drag-resize. **L-014 (react-resizable-panels 4.x quirks)** matters any time PanelLayout is restructured: numeric `Panel.defaultSize` props are PIXELS not percentages (use `"NN%"` strings); `Group.defaultLayout` is effectively an SSR hint, `Panel.defaultSize` is the canonical client knob.
6. **[tasks/lt4_phase_4_1_acceptance.md](lt4_phase_4_1_acceptance.md)** — parity acceptance checklist. §16 lists intentional divergences from legacy. The 2026 redesign's structural moves don't update this doc; treat it as parity baseline for the legacy `--legacy-ui` path only.
7. Recent `git log --oneline -20` — Phase 1 + 2 of the redesign at the tip, prior LT-4 dispatch history below.

## Resumable state (snapshot)

| Thing | Value |
|---|---|
| **Worktree** | `C:\Modding\Particle Editor\.claude\worktrees\angry-hypatia-6a4efe` (this session's; next session gets a fresh `claude/<random>` path) |
| **Branch** | `claude/angry-hypatia-6a4efe` → integrates back into `lt-4` per the standard end-of-session FF. Tracks `origin/lt-4`. |
| **HEAD (committed)** | `TODO-HASH` (this T8 docs commit). Session has 3 close-out commits ahead of `origin/lt-4`: `ba8a3de` (T4c.5) + `f3e2ea0` (T6) + this docs commit. Plus the 12 mid-arc commits already on `origin/lt-4` at `962e5f4` (the prior session's mid-arc handoff). |
| **Working tree** | clean (after docs commit). |
| **Ahead of origin/lt-4** | 3 (T4c.5 + T6 + this docs commit) — pending FF + push to `origin/lt-4` with the user's OK. Pre-FF `origin/lt-4` HEAD is `962e5f4` (prior session's mid-arc handoff commit). |
| **Behind master** | `lt-4` is ~380+ commits ahead of `master` (`b28f624`); none merged yet, all backed up to `origin/lt-4`. |
| **Open PRs** | none |
| **Build status** | MSBuild Debug x64 clean (preexisting LIBCMTD warning). C++ touched this session: `AlphaCompositor::CaptureSnapshotPng` crop (T4c.5). Vitest **294 / 294**. Playwright **90 / 90**. |
| **Phase status** | Particle Editor 2026 redesign — **Phase 1 + Phase 2 + curve editor polish + B1 + B1.2 + B1.2.1 + B1.3 + B1.3.1 + B1.3.1.1 + B1.3.2 + B1.4 [NT-8] SHIPPED.** B1.4 pending FF (3 commits). Next dispatch options listed at top of file. Phase 3 of the 2026 redesign (dialog re-skin, Tailwind cleanup, theme-persistence test) remains not started. Legacy `--legacy-ui` mode is untouched throughout. |

**Worktree note.** The Claude Code desktop app provisions a fresh worktree on every session start; this session was in `agitated-margulis-854108`, succeeding `brave-buck-1295c8`. Branch name follows the worktree name. The commit lineage is preserved — only the path / branch label change.

**Sister-worktree sync note.** Prior sessions noted `lt-4` checked out at `C:/Modding/Particle Editor/.claude/worktrees/great-varahamihira-b66cf4` with a stale local ref. The fresh `claude/<random>` worktree the desktop app provisions for the next session branches directly from `origin/lt-4` so the per-worktree local ref doesn't matter; only the sister-worktree case (someone manually checking out `lt-4`) needs `git fetch && git merge --ff-only origin/lt-4` before working there.

**NuGet pre-flight (fresh worktrees only).** `.gitignore` excludes `packages/`, so the first MSBuild in a fresh worktree fails with *"missing Microsoft.Web.WebView2.targets"*. Restore explicitly before the first build:

```bash
"/c/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/18/Community/MSBuild/Current/Bin/MSBuild.exe" \
  "ParticleEditor.sln" //t:Restore //v:m
```

Then the standard Debug x64 build works. Skip this step on a worktree that's already been built in once.

## What landed this session — B1.3.2 (1 impl commit + 1 docs commit, PENDING FF)

In execution order (newest first):

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `TODO-HASH` | **docs(LT-4): B1.3.2 handoff — shared section CSS + 15 polish items shipped.** This docs commit. Adds CHANGELOG entry; refreshes HANDOFF + todo.md review. |
| [`65a5eae`](https://github.com/DrKnickers/new-particle-editor/commit/65a5eae) | **feat(LT-4): B1.3.2 — unify section headers + inspector polish rounds.** Shared `.panel-section` CSS class consumed by both `Section.tsx` (controlled `useState` + `data-open`) and `ToolPanel.Section` (native `<details>`); rotation selector bridges the two state shapes. Lucide ChevronDown replaces ASCII `›` in ToolPanel.Section. Legacy `.section-*` CSS deleted; `.section-divider` kept as standalone hairline primitive. Same commit folds 15 inspector polish items: dropdowns widened where long labels truncated (Physics Type / Appearance Blend mode / Basic Emit mode / Physics Behavior); Tail length spinner +25 % width; RGBA cluster gains R/G/B/A micro-labels + 2x2 layout; long-label checkboxes (Link particles to instance + Object space acceleration) adopt `inlineLabel` prop with label-wraps-not-truncates; ALL checkboxes right-edge-align via `grid-column: 2; justify-self: end` (pins right edge to spinner number-input column's right edge across every form-row width variant); Basic-tab numeric spinners get +25 % width via single scoped `.basic-tab .form-row` CSS rule; Spawn now button moves into Mode section (manual-only); Burst becomes collapsible. New `widthBoost?: "mid" \| "wide" \| "x2"` prop on FieldSelect / FieldSpinner maps to .form-row-mid-input / -wide-input / -x2-input CSS modifiers (73 / 87 / 116 px input columns). |

## What landed this session — B1.3.1.1 (4 impl commits + 1 docs commit, FF'd mid-session at `37a99fb`)

In execution order (oldest → newest):

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| [`1e49d37`](https://github.com/DrKnickers/new-particle-editor/commit/1e49d37) | **feat(LT-4): B1.3.1.1 P2+P3 — engine viewport snapshot bridge surface.** AlphaCompositor caches a pre-stamp BGRA DIB in `m_lastRawDib` each frame (after readback memcpy, before stamps). New `CaptureSnapshotPng(outBase64, outW, outH)` method wraps the cached pixels zero-copy in a `Gdiplus::Bitmap` (`PixelFormat32bppARGB`, BGRA byte order matches), saves to PNG via in-memory IStream, base64-encodes via inline 30-line encoder. LayoutBroker.CaptureSnapshotPng forwards to the compositor. BridgeDispatcher adds the `viewport/capture-snapshot` handler returning `{ pngBase64, w, h }` on success or empty payload when no frame has composited yet. HostWindow brackets the message pump with `Gdiplus::GdiplusStartup/Shutdown`. Schema entry + MockBridge stub (empty-PNG short-circuits the render guard). |
| [`f3570d3`](https://github.com/DrKnickers/new-particle-editor/commit/f3570d3) | **feat(LT-4): B1.3.1.1 P4 — Modal frosted-glass backdrop via engine snapshot.** Modal's useEffect drives snapshot capture + full-quadrant occlude on open; renders the returned PNG as an `<img position:absolute; inset:0>` via `createPortal` into the quadrant-viewport DOM; cleanup on close. Regression test pivots from `set-modal-mask` assertion to the new contract + `expect.not.toHaveBeenCalledWith({ kind: "viewport/set-modal-mask" })` to lock the upcoming deletion. The existing opaque-bg / no-backdrop-filter / no-shadow-xl regression guards stay. |
| [`cb7b4c7`](https://github.com/DrKnickers/new-particle-editor/commit/cb7b4c7) | **fix(LT-4): B1.3.1.1 P5 polish — sentinel-rect occlude + one-shot capture.** Two smoke-test findings, same root cause (Win32 modal sizing loop starves WebView2 IPC — L-013). (1) Drag-resize leaks opaque engine pixels because the renderer-side rect can't reach the host during the modal loop. Fix: sentinel rect (-1e5, -1e5, 2e5, 2e5) — `ApplyOcclusion` clips to current DIB bounds, resize-resilient by construction without needing fresh round-trips. (2) Drag-resize stutters because per-frame ~10-30 ms GDI+ encodes stack on the engine's per-WM_SIZE D3D9 Reset. Fix: capture once on modal open, never re-capture — img scales via CSS, blur hides content staleness. |
| [`c287033`](https://github.com/DrKnickers/new-particle-editor/commit/c287033) | **refactor(LT-4): B1.3.1.1 P6 — drop modal-mask compositor pipeline.** Deletes the now-dead server-side machinery: `SetModalMask`, `BoxBlurDibBgra`, `MultiplyDibAlphaBgra`, `FadePopupEdges`, `Smoothstep01Edge` helpers; `m_globalAlpha` / `m_blurRadius` / `m_blurScratch` fields; the modal-mask call sites in Composite; LayoutBroker's SetModalMask declaration + forwarding; BridgeDispatcher's viewport/set-modal-mask handler; schema entry; MockBridge case. **256 lines net deleted from AlphaCompositor.cpp.** The Modal regression test from P4 already asserts no set-modal-mask dispatch via `expect.not.toHaveBeenCalledWith`, locking the deletion. |
| `TODO-HASH` | **docs(LT-4): handoff — B1.3.1.1 shipped.** This docs commit. CHANGELOG entry at top; ROADMAP strikes NT-9 + moves to position 5.1 in Shipped (renumbering Near-term 1.x and Shipped 5.x throughout); lessons.md L-013 added (Win32 modal sizing loop starves WebView2 IPC); todo.md gets a review section; HANDOFF refreshed for next session. |

## Previously landed (kept for context)

B1.3.1 + 9 polish rounds (shipped at `386c37b` on `origin/lt-4` via the prior session's FF — the dispatch directly preceding this one). Core B1.3.1 landed always-mounted tab strip + flex split between tree and tabs (25/75 favouring tabs). Polish rounds 1-9 covered: split-ratio tuning, inspector right-padding + toolbar File wiring + tree-toolbar pinning, file-open emit tree-changed + ReloadTextures, ViewportPill + Recents submenu occlusion registration, Shift+LMB cursor-bound spawn, Modal overlay occlusion + diagnostic-logs round, opaque chrome where HTML effects can't reach engine, BridgeContext (replacing broken `window.bridge`), modal-mask compositor pipeline (interim — DELETED in this session's B1.3.1.1 dispatch). 11 commits total + a docs commit. Lessons.md L-011 (HTML CSS effects can't reach engine compositing layer) and L-012 (`window.bridge` → use BridgeContext) filed.

B1.3 (the dispatch before that, shipped at `f12d6f2`) restructured the three property tabs to legacy `IDD_EMITTER_PROPS1/2/3` shape — three Sections per tab matching legacy GROUPBOX structure section-for-section, twelve field placements migrated to legacy homes, tri-state Generation radio mutex with full a11y plumbing (`role="radiogroup"` + roving tabIndex + arrow-key cycling), a bundled `displayInvertedPercent` correctness fix on `FieldSpinner` (the new UI was reading `randomLifetimePerc=0.25` as `0.25%` instead of legacy's `75%` minimum), trailing-colon label convention applied to every field, "World Oriented" → "Always face camera" with semantic flip, four fields dropped from UI but retained on the wire (`nTriangles`, `weatherFadeoutDistance`, `groups[1]` Lifetime random-param, `index`). Two two-stage-review fix commits caught real issues — `b929e47` (a11y RadioRow extraction) and `3b191fd` (weather-disable cascade parity per legacy `src/UI/Emitter.cpp:175-190`). Two polish rounds folded user smoke-test findings — `3ae940e` (dark scrollbar inside Tabs.Content + form-row template tuning) and `82917f0` (per-axis X/Y/Z micro-labels above every Vec3 cluster + texture-input widening + SpawnerPanel scroll fix). 14 commits total, FF'd to `origin/lt-4` at the end of that session. **Lessons.md L-010** filed: inspector field labels are public API; sweep BOTH vitest and Playwright on every rename.

The earlier Phase 1 + Phase 2 + curve-editor-polish dispatches are still the structural foundation under B1 + B1.2 + B1.3. In execution order (oldest → newest):

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `c92c76e` | **docs(LT-4): re-plan Phase 1 for Tailwind v4 reality** — rewrote Phase 1 of the plan in place when the original draft turned out to assume Tailwind v3 with a JS `tailwind.config.ts` that doesn't exist (project is on Tailwind v4, CSS-first `@theme`). Phase 1 renumbered to 7 tasks (was 8); the deleted Task 1.3 ("Extend Tailwind config") folded into the new Task 1.1's `@theme inline` block. |
| `9df821d` | **feat(LT-4): Phase 1 — token system + theme toggle** — single squashed commit. New CSS files under `src/styles/` (`tokens.css` with `:root` + `[data-theme="light"]` + `@theme inline`; `base.css` with `@font-face` for Inter + scrollbar styling; `components.css` from the design bundle's reusable classes). Inter variable woff2 bundled at `public/fonts/inter/InterVariable.woff2` (note rename from the spec's stale filename). `globals.css` drops the legacy `@theme` block (verified zero consumers) and imports the three new files. `ThemeToggle.tsx` is a Sun / Moon segmented control; theme persists to `localStorage('alo:theme')` with a `matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')` fallback. `App.tsx` applies the same logic at mount so first paint is themed. `test-setup.ts` gains `localStorage` + `matchMedia` stubs and an `afterEach localStorage.clear()`. 30-file utility-class sweep replaces `bg-neutral-*` / `text-neutral-*` / `border-neutral-*` / `sky-*` with token-backed equivalents per a fixed substitution table. |
| `24179ec` | **fix(LT-4): align five View-menu items missing the CheckSlot indent** — Step Forward / Reset Camera / Reload Shaders / Reload Textures / Reset View Settings were rendering text flush against the menu's left padding while sibling items with checkboxes had 14 px of indent. Fix is one empty `<CheckSlot active={false} />` per item. Pre-existing alignment bug; surfaced during Phase 1 visual verification. |
| `64b49ed` | **feat(LT-4): Phase 2.1 — toolbar reorganization** — Toolbar.tsx uses the design's semantic classes (`.toolbar` / `.tb-group` / `.tb-btn` / `.tb-divider` / `.tb-spacer`); four groups (File · Playback · Spawner toggle · spacer · Environment + ThemeToggle); removes Undo/Redo/Bloom/Reload (they live in the menubar); adds Save As and Step 10; new `useSpawnerVisibility` per-component hook (upgraded in 2.4). |
| `6aa6206` | **feat(LT-4): Phase 2.2 — Background → toolbar dropdown popover** — new `BackgroundDropdown` + `OccludingPopover` (generalisation of `OccludingMenubarContent` so the popover registers as a viewport occlusion). `BackgroundPicker` body extracted as `BackgroundPickerBody`. Slide-in mount removed from App.tsx. `BackgroundButton.tsx` deleted. |
| `2a77249` | **feat(LT-4): Phase 2.3 — Ground → toolbar dropdown popover** — same pattern. New `GroundDropdown`; `GroundTexturePanelBody` extracted. |
| `2759c27` | **chore(LT-4): remove dead Background/Ground Texture entries from View menu** — small follow-up to 2.2/2.3. The View menu's "Background…" and "Ground Texture…" items had been left in place during the per-task commits; they were no-ops after the slide-ins came out. Now removed along with their `onOpen*` props. |
| `17768b6` | **feat(LT-4): Phase 2.4 — Spawner permanent right column** — `useSpawnerVisibility` upgraded to a Zustand store (`useSpawnerVisible` / `useToggleSpawner` / `toggleSpawner` + a `useSpawnerVisibility` compat shim + `__resetSpawnerVisibilityForTests`). SpawnerPanel uses `.panel` / `.panel-header` (X-close → toggleSpawner) / `.panel-body` instead of ToolPanel. App.tsx workspace becomes 3-column when visible. Emitters menu's "Spawner…" rewired to `toggleSpawner`. |
| `0fd093d` | **feat(LT-4): Phase 2.5 — left panel restack with .panel chrome + .form-row grid** — left column wraps in `.panel` chrome (header "Particle System"). The 46-ish form rows across Basic / Appearance / Physics tabs convert to the design's `.form-row` 3-column grid (label / input / unit) via the existing `FieldText` / `FieldSpinner` / `FieldCheckbox` primitives. Multi-spinner clusters (Random Colours, Acceleration, Vec3Row) use `gridColumn: "2 / span 2"` inline as a tactical workaround. |
| `329c595` | **feat(LT-4): Phase 2.6 — curve editor moves to always-on bottom 260px** — new `CurveEditorPanel.tsx` in the centre column's bottom row; 7-channel curve-list (Scale / R / G / B / A / Rotation / Index — Index defaults off); multi-channel SVG overlay rendering one `<g data-testid="curve-layer-${id}">` per visible channel. **This commit deleted `TrackEditor.tsx` (866 lines) and `EmitterPropertyPanel.tsx` (176 lines) entirely**, losing the entire curve edit surface (Time/Value spinners, marquee, drag, Insert mode, interpolation toggle, lock-to combo, per-key context menu, panel-level Delete handler). Phase 2.8 restores them on top of this rendering substrate. |
| `83ee7a5` | **feat(LT-4): Phase 2.7 — viewport pill + engine/set/leave-particles bridge** — new top-left vertical pill in the viewport with three engine toggles (Show ground / Toggle bloom / Leave particles after instance death). The leave-particles bridge surface is new end-to-end (schema + MockBridge + C++ dispatcher), wired to ParticleSystem's existing `getLeaveParticles()` / `setLeaveParticles()` methods — the runtime path was already chunk-serialised + honoured at `Engine::KillParticleSystem`. |
| `3cd840a` | **feat(LT-4): hybrid focus-channel curve editor — restore edit surface** — restores everything Task 2.6 deleted on top of the multi-channel overlay using a focus-channel model. Clicking a channel row sets that channel as the edit focus (visible indicator: `data-focus="true"` + `bg-accent-soft`); the focus channel's curve renders thick + opaque + interactive while the other visible channels render thin + dimmed + non-interactive as background context. New `.ce-toolbar` row above the canvas with Select / Insert mode toggle, Linear / Smooth / Step interpolation, Lock-to combo, Time / Value spinners (L-006 sticky optimistic override). Window-scoped Delete keyboard handler with `TYPING_TAGS` guard. Vitest +19 (200 → 219); Playwright +4 (78 → 82 passing). |
| `339ab95` | **feat(LT-4): curve editor polish — lock-to, axis labels, theme grid, robust spinners, spawner bg fix** — the dispatch immediately preceding B1, FF'd to `origin/lt-4`. Lock-to wired end-to-end (`emitters/set-track-lock`), HTML axis labels, theme-aware grid via CSS variables, native-wheel-listener spinners, Spawner panel bg opacity. Vitest 219 → 221. |

## Open items (load-bearing — read before resuming)

### 0. ~~B1.3.1.1 [NT-9]~~ ✅ SHIPPED on session branch (NOT YET FF'd)

Full breakdown in the "What landed this session" table above and the top-of-CHANGELOG entry. The snapshot-into-DOM approach landed cleanly across four commits; the modal-mask C++ machinery is gone. The end-of-session FF + push to `origin/lt-4` is pending the user's OK.

### 0a. B1.4 [NT-8] — Resizable splitters via `react-resizable-panels` (NEXT DISPATCH)

Now top of Near-term. Same scope as previously planned: drag the left/centre/right column boundaries (and the tree/tabs split inside the left column) via `react-resizable-panels`, persist to `localStorage`. Defaults match B1.3.1's 25/75 inner split and the existing fixed-width column sizes. No bridge schema, no C++. Standard CLAUDE.md plan expected.

### 0b. B2 obsolescence audit (small warm-up alternative)

B1.3 wired every field on the Appearance and Physics tabs through the existing `commit()` helper as part of the restructure — they now drive engine state through the bridge identically to BasicTab. Before re-scoping or executing B2 as originally planned, the next session should diff the current Appearance + Physics implementations against B2's original target spec and verify what (if anything) remains undone. A quick "audit B2 scope" sub-task probably resolves the entire item to "retire B2 — fully covered by B1.3".

### 0c. MT-1 follow-up — Texture picker "..." buttons still unimplemented

Legacy `IDC_BUTTON1` / `IDC_BUTTON2` at [`src/ParticleEditor.en.rc:387-389`](../src/ParticleEditor.en.rc) are not wired in the new UI. MT-1 covers the recents/pinned case; the "..." browse path needs the same React equivalent. Comment marker `TODO(MT-1)` exists in `EmitterPropertyTabs.tsx` for grep-ability.

### 0d. Legacy B1.3.1.1 planning notes (kept for reference if you need the design rationale)

**Why the snapshot-into-DOM approach is the right one** (investigated across the prior B1.3.1 polish rounds + this session's smoke-tests):
- HTML CSS effects (`backdrop-filter`, `box-shadow` of any large extent) can't sample engine viewport pixels — engine is a separate compositing layer (FD9b layered Win32 popup), not a DOM element. L-011 has the full rationale.
- Server-side dim+blur of the engine (the modal-mask path) works for the engine pixels themselves, but the popup HWND boundary against the CSS-dimmed panels still draws a visible rectangle.
- The snapshot-into-DOM approach lifts engine pixels INTO the WebView2 DOM tree (frozen at one frame), so CSS effects sample them natively. No layer boundary visible.

**Open implementation choices flagged (decided in prior session):**
- PNG encoding via GDI+ (already in Windows SDK).
- Live re-capture on window resize (rAF-throttled).
- Skip nested-modals concern (not a current use case).

### 0a. ~~B1.4 [NT-8]~~ — Resizable splitters via `react-resizable-panels` (queued behind B1.3.1.1)

Now the second-priority. Same scope as previously planned: drag the left/centre/right column boundaries (and the tree/tabs split inside the left column) via `react-resizable-panels`, persist to `localStorage`. Defaults match B1.3.1's 25/75 inner split and the existing fixed-width column sizes. No bridge schema, no C++. Standard CLAUDE.md plan expected.

### 0b. B2 obsolescence audit (small warm-up alternative)

B1.3 wired every field on the Appearance and Physics tabs through the existing `commit()` helper as part of the restructure — they now drive engine state through the bridge identically to BasicTab. Before re-scoping or executing B2 as originally planned, the next session should diff the current Appearance + Physics implementations against B2's original target spec and verify what (if anything) remains undone. A quick "audit B2 scope" sub-task probably resolves the entire item to "retire B2 — fully covered by B1.3".

### 0c. MT-1 follow-up — Texture picker "..." buttons still unimplemented

Legacy `IDC_BUTTON1` / `IDC_BUTTON2` at [`src/ParticleEditor.en.rc:387-389`](../src/ParticleEditor.en.rc) (the "..." browse buttons next to the Color and Bump texture filename inputs) are not wired in the new UI. The MT-1 frequently-used textures palette covers the common case (pick from recents / pinned), but the "..." browse path — `GetOpenFileName` filtered to `*.dds;*.tga;*.png;*.jpg` — needs the same React equivalent to land. Worth filing as a separate dispatch once B1.4 ships. Comment marker `TODO(MT-1)` exists in `EmitterPropertyTabs.tsx` for grep-ability.

### 1. ~~B1.3.1 inspector layout follow-ups~~ + 9 polish rounds ✅ SHIPPED on the session branch (NOT YET FF'd)

12 commits total on the session branch — see the "What landed this session" table above for the full breakdown. The core B1.3.1 work (always-mounted tab strip + 25/75 flex split) ships clean; the 9 subsequent polish rounds cover everything from inspector right-padding to the modal-mask compositor pipeline. **Round 9 has a known visual artifact** (inner-shadow halo at the popup boundary when a modal is open) — explicitly documented as superseded by the next session's B1.3.1.1 dispatch.

**Status:** 12 commits ready to FF; user has not yet OK'd the push. The FF decision is itself a choice — either FF now (interim state with the inner-shadow artifact lands on `lt-4`) or wait for B1.3.1.1 to complete then FF the whole arc together.

**Recommended:** FF now. The artifact is real but tolerable, the B1.3.1 core is genuinely shipped + valuable, and `origin/lt-4` is a backup branch (not master) so the cost of having an interim state there is low.

### 1b. ~~B1.3 tab parity reorg~~ ✅ SHIPPED previous session (FF'd to `origin/lt-4` at `f12d6f2`)

P1 (pre-flight) → P8 (this docs commit), 10 implementation commits + 2 docs commits (spec, plan). Two two-stage-review fix commits caught real issues — P3 follow-up `b929e47` (a11y RadioRow extraction) and P6 follow-up `3b191fd` (weather-disable cascade parity). Two polish rounds folded user smoke-test findings (`3ae940e` dark scrollbar + form-row truncation; `82917f0` Vec3 axis labels + cluster widening + Spawner scroll). See top-of-CHANGELOG entry for the full breakdown; high-level summary:

- **Three property tabs match legacy `IDD_EMITTER_PROPS1/2/3` section structure** (Basic: Emitter Timing / Generation / Connection; Appearance: Textures / Random color / Tail / Rotation / Rendering; Physics: Initial position / Initial speed / Acceleration / Ground interaction).
- **Twelve field placements migrated to legacy homes** — rotation cluster, parent link strength, random scale, affected-by-wind, emit mode/offset, weather particle + cube size + fadeout distance.
- **Tri-state Generation radio mutex** with atomic two-key bridge patches; hand-rolled `RadioRow` component with `role="radiogroup"` + roving tabIndex + arrow-key cycling.
- **`displayInvertedPercent` prop** on `FieldSpinner` — bundled correctness fix for "Minimum lifetime:" and "Minimum scale:" (the new UI was displaying `0.25` as `0.25%` instead of legacy's `75%` minimum).
- **"Always face camera"** label replaces "World Oriented" with semantic flip; BLEND_BUMP cascade preserved.
- **Trailing-colon label convention** applied to every field; section titles stay colon-less.
- **`GroupSection` renamed `GroupBody`** — wraps inside parent `Section`; fieldset/legend chrome dropped.
- **Per-axis X/Y/Z micro-labels** above every Vec3 cluster (inspector + Spawner).
- **Four fields dropped from UI** (`nTriangles`, `weatherFadeoutDistance`, `groups[1]`, `index`) — all four stay on the wire for round-trip safety.

**Status:** 13 commits ready to FF into `lt-4` at user's explicit OK.

### 1b. ~~B1 left-pane realignment~~ ✅ SHIPPED (FF'd to `origin/lt-4` two sessions ago)

P1–P8 implementation + brainstorm + plan + the B1 P9 docs commit. Full breakdown in CHANGELOG entry from earlier this month.

Two ROADMAP follow-ups filed for B1 work that's worth doing later but deliberately out-of-scope:

- **[NT-5] Engine-side single-member link-group enforcement.** B1 ships a render-layer filter; the data layer can still carry single-member groups. NT-5 makes the data layer match the rendered view end-to-end across the three C++ mutation paths.
- **[NT-6] Visual-stability lane assignment for bracket gutter (option).** B1 uses aggressive-reuse greedy first-fit; a setting that opts the user into `lane = (groupId - 1) % maxLanes` would keep lanes stable across renders. Only worth doing if the bouncing turns out to be a real ergonomic issue.

### 1c. ~~B1.2 left-pane polish + B1.2.1 label-truncation polish~~ ✅ SHIPPED (FF'd to `origin/lt-4` prior session)

Full breakdown in the corresponding CHANGELOG entry. Predecessor on `lt-4` is `4edcc3a` (`docs(LT-4): handoff for new session — B1.3 reorg proposal + B1.2.1 polish in HANDOFF`).

### 1. ~~Ground-texture engine bug~~ ✅ FIXED 2026-05-20 (commit `92ed1db`)

The ground-texture lockup is fixed. Root cause: `m_pSkydomeEffect` (added in MT-3) was missing from `Engine::Reset`'s `OnLostDevice` / `OnResetDevice` pattern, leaving `D3DPOOL_DEFAULT` references active across `IDirect3DDevice9::Reset` → device latched at `D3DERR_DEVICENOTRESET` → all subsequent `D3DX*` calls failed with `D3DERR_NOTAVAILABLE`. Two-line fix in [`engine.cpp:1360`](src/engine.cpp:1360). Belt-and-suspenders: `Engine::RecoverDeviceIfNeeded()` ([`engine.h:123`](src/engine.h:123)) + `LayoutBroker::Apply` catch-path fallback. Full diagnostic trail in [`tasks/lessons.md` L-007](lessons.md).

**`abort()` dialog (user-reported, prior handoff).** Not reproduced. Probably a separate code path; could have been a stale capture. Worth checking if it resurfaces.

### 1b. ~~Curve editor polish~~ ✅ SHIPPED 2026-05-20 (commit `339ab95` FF'd to `origin/lt-4`)

A round of interactive smoke-testing through the curve editor surfaced a stack of issues the user wanted addressed. All fixed and verified through `pnpm build` + `pnpm test` + MSBuild + `pnpm test:native` (83/83). See top-of-CHANGELOG entry for the full breakdown; high-level summary:

- **Spawner panel transparent leak** → `bg-panel` on the right aside.
- **Curve editor strip layout** → `minmax(0, 1fr)` row/col templates, `h-[290px]`, `flex: 1` on `.curve-editor`.
- **Lock-to feature wired end-to-end** → new schema kind `emitters/set-track-lock`, C++ handler swapping `emit->tracks[i]` pointer, `TrackDto.lockedTo` derived from pointer equality, React dispatches on dropdown change, edit affordances disable when locked.
- **Per-channel value-range rules** → RGBA fixed `{0,1}`, Scale/Index auto-grow upper, Rotation auto-grows both ways with no caps.
- **Spinner-bounds vs display-range split** → fixed the "can't push Scale past 20" deadlock.
- **Toolbar icons** (Lucide + inline SVG glyphs for the interp modes) with `flex-wrap` fallback for narrow windows.
- **Spinner improvements** → always-visible arrows, native-wheel-listener-with-`{passive:false}` (bypasses React 18 passive default), wheel works anywhere over the spinner including the arrow column.
- **HTML axis labels** in a CSS-grid sibling cell (avoids `preserveAspectRatio="none"` glyph distortion).
- **Theme-aware grid colours** via `--curve-grid` / `--curve-axis` CSS variables (dimmer in light theme).
- **`overflow="visible"` on the SVG** so endpoint key circles draw their full body even when their centre is on the grid edge.

**Status:** FF'd to `origin/lt-4` at the start of this session as `339ab95`. No outstanding work.

### 1c. ~~B1 left-pane realignment~~ ✅ SHIPPED (FF'd to `origin/lt-4` at the start of this session)

P1–P8 implementation + brainstorm + plan + the B1 P9 docs commit. FF + push completed at session start. Full breakdown in the "B1 trailing commits" table above and the second CHANGELOG entry.

Two ROADMAP follow-ups filed for B1 work that's worth doing later but deliberately out-of-scope:

- **[NT-5] Engine-side single-member link-group enforcement.** B1 ships a render-layer filter; the data layer can still carry single-member groups. NT-5 makes the data layer match the rendered view end-to-end across the three C++ mutation paths.
- **[NT-6] Visual-stability lane assignment for bracket gutter (option).** B1 uses aggressive-reuse greedy first-fit; a setting that opts the user into `lane = (groupId - 1) % maxLanes` would keep lanes stable across renders. Only worth doing if the bouncing turns out to be a real ergonomic issue.

### 1d. ~~B1.2 left-pane polish~~ ✅ SHIPPED earlier this session (FF'd to `origin/lt-4` at `e99e7b5`)

P2 Section + P3 BasicTab restructure + P3-fix `.name-row` refactor + P4 Duplicate + P5 Show/Hide icon swap + P6 CHANGELOG/HANDOFF + partial-backfill commit. Full breakdown in the "What landed this session" table above and the second CHANGELOG entry from the top.

### 1e. ~~B1.2.1 inspector label-truncation polish~~ ✅ SHIPPED this session (uncommitted FF + handoff docs — needs push)

Single follow-up fix commit `3a7a159` ("inspector label-truncation polish") catching three layered causes of label truncation that user-testing surfaced after B1.2 landed: double padding on Basic-tab Tabs.Content + design-source form-row template tuned for shorter labels + section bodies missing the indent needed to align with section title text. No new tests, no test count delta. User accepted the fix mid-session.

This handoff-refresh docs commit + the `tasks/b1.3_legacy_parity_reorg_proposal.md` commit are the docs for this round; all three (polish fix + proposal doc + this HANDOFF) push together to `origin/lt-4` at session close.

### 2. Phase 2 / 3 references to `tailwind.config.ts` in the plan still need v4 translation

Phase 1 of the plan was rewritten in place ([`c92c76e`](https://github.com/DrKnickers/new-particle-editor/commit/c92c76e)) when the original draft assumed Tailwind v3. Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the same plan still reference `tailwind.config.ts` in a few spots — those need the same translation (config moves to a `@theme inline` block in CSS; entry stylesheet is `src/styles/globals.css` not `src/index.css`; the `body { bg-transparent }` FD4 invariant must be preserved). Search the plan for `tailwind.config.ts` to find the spots; the Phase 1 re-plan note documents the translation pattern.

### 3. Phase 3 outstanding work

Per [the plan](../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-19-particle-editor-2026-redesign.md), Phase 3 is the cleanup pass:

- **3.1** Modal primitive re-style (cascades to every consuming dialog).
- **3.2** ModNicknameDialog wiring + new `mods/set-nickname` bridge surface (right-click on a Mods menu entry → opens the nickname dialog → writes nickname → re-scans + propagates).
- **3.3** Per-dialog visual passes (ImportEmittersDialog / ModNicknameDialog / RescaleDialog / RescaleEmitterDialog / AboutDialog / SaveChangesPrompt / IncrementIndexDialog / LinkGroupSettingsDialog) — re-skin each dialog body against the new tokens.
- **3.4** Tailwind leftover cleanup sweep (grep for any remaining `bg-neutral-*` / `sky-*` etc. that the Phase 1.6 sweep missed).
- **3.5** Theme persistence Playwright spec (`tests/theme-persistence.spec.ts` driving the ThemeToggle and asserting via `localStorage` + `dataset.theme`).
- **3.6** Docs + final verification + ship — CHANGELOG entries already exist from Phase 1 / 2 / 2.8; Phase 3 adds its own.

Phase 3 is mostly mechanical and smaller surface than Phase 2. Reasonable to do in one session.

### 4. Phase 4.2 cutover still gated

The redesign work is on `lt-4`; legacy `--legacy-ui` Win32 mode is untouched. Phase 4.2 (delete legacy chrome at `src/UI/` and the legacy `main.cpp` paths) is still gated on the user signing off on parity acceptance at [`tasks/lt4_phase_4_1_acceptance.md`](lt4_phase_4_1_acceptance.md) §17 (currently empty). The 2026 redesign may shift the parity conversation — much of the "is parity good enough" question gets resolved by the new design hitting production polish.

## Hard-won lessons (preserve!)

All in `tasks/lessons.md`. **Read L-002, L-003, L-004, L-006 carefully before any test / build / optimistic-state work.**

- **L-001** — Don't infer binary provenance from bitness + timestamp alone (Petroglyph 64-bit patch incident).
- **L-002** — Repo-root `.gitignore` `**/packages/*` eats `web/packages/*` source; use scoped negation.
- **L-003** — WebView2 silently drops `chrome.webview.postMessage` after CDP attachment. Playwright contract tests route through `chrome.webview.hostObjects.hostBridge` instead.
- **L-004** — `pnpm test` (Vitest) doesn't type-check. `tsc --noEmit` (single-project) ≠ `tsc -b` (build mode with project references). Truth is `pnpm build`. Verification sequence: `pnpm build` → `pnpm test` → `pnpm test:native`.
- **L-005** — pnpm v11 `allowBuilds:` block wants a boolean, not the literal placeholder string. Edit the workspace yaml directly.
- **L-006** — Don't clear React optimistic state on every host-data refresh. Use sticky overrides cleared only on explicit user-action selection-change. **Now load-bearing in `CurveEditorPanel.tsx` — Phase 2.8's Time/Value spinners use this pattern.**
- **L-007** — When a Playwright contract test fails and the "obvious fix" is to rewrite what the test asserts, verify the rewrite *in-situ under the failing conditions* before relying on it. The bigger test failing while the smaller passes can mean either (a) the bigger was too brittle, or (b) the engine has a real bug that the smaller test ALSO can't see in isolation. Always check (b) before declaring (a). Caught the ground-texture engine bug this session — without the in-situ check, the test-rewrite "fix" would have shipped a silent regression.
- **L-008** — React 18 attaches `wheel` listeners as passive at the root; use a native `addEventListener` with `{ passive: false }` when you need `preventDefault()` to actually work. Otherwise the wheel scroll leaks to the parent pane.
- **L-009** — Never use raw floats as identity keys across the JS/C++ boundary; pre-round at the source with `Math.fround`. The JS `double` ↔ C++ `float` round-trip silently drifts ~1 ULP-of-float32 and breaks any `===` or `Set/Map` keyed lookup.
- **L-010** — Inspector field labels are public API; sweep BOTH vitest and Playwright on every rename. Vitest specs under `src/**/__tests__/` and Playwright specs under `tests/` run via different harnesses, but both can hard-code field labels as DOM selectors. Filed this session after B1.3's P7 caught two label-coupled Playwright specs the spec hadn't anticipated.

### Patterns from this session worth remembering

#### `displayInvertedPercent` prop for legacy inverted-percent fields

The legacy editor's `randomLifetimePerc` and `randomScalePerc` display the *minimum* percentage rather than the random-fraction directly: `displayedPercent = 100 - value * 100`. When wiring legacy fields whose label reads "Minimum X:" but whose schema field stores a 0..1 random-fraction, the inversion is part of the contract — not a UI quirk. The pattern lives on `FieldSpinner` as `displayInvertedPercent?: boolean`; consumers just pass the prop and the spinner handles both render-side (`displayed = 100 - value * 100`) and commit-side (`value = (100 - displayed) / 100`) transforms. Audit before adding any new "Minimum ..." label against the legacy `.rc` to see if the same inversion applies.

#### `.axis-cell` / `.axis-lbl` micro-labels above Vec3 clusters

Three side-by-side spinners (X / Y / Z, R / G / B / A, etc.) become much more legible with tiny dimmed letters directly above each spinner cell. The pattern is `.form-row.form-row-cluster` (60px label + 1fr cluster) wrapping a row of `.axis-cell` containers, each with a `.axis-lbl` text node above its spinner. Pixel-tight and zero-impact on test selectors (labels stay aria-attached to the spinner inputs). Applied across PhysicsTab Vec3Row + Acceleration, AppearanceTab RGBA, and all four SpawnerPanel Vec3 sections in `82917f0`.

#### Source-resolve open questions before brainstorm

B1.3's five open questions could have entered brainstorm as "needs decision"; instead they were resolved by reading `src/UI/Emitter.cpp:480-560` (the WM_COMMAND handler that maps each IDC_SPINNER to a schema field) and `src/ParticleEditor.en.rc` (the dialog templates) directly. Brainstorm then ran in a single confirmation pass rather than a multi-round Q-and-A. Pattern: when the work touches a legacy surface that's already in the repo, the questions worth asking the user are the *taste* questions ("trailing colons?"), not the *fact* questions ("what schema field does IDC_SPINNER2 bind to?"). Source-read first.

#### Two-stage review on every implementation phase

P3 and P6 each shipped twice: first the implementation pass, then a code-review pass that caught a real issue (P3: missing a11y; P6: inverted weather-disable cascade). The two-stage cadence isn't formality — it's the difference between "looks right" and "matches the legacy contract line-by-line". Bake into every multi-tab dispatch.

#### Tailwind v4 vs v3 — CSS-first vs JS-config

Tailwind v4 generates utility classes from CSS variables in `@theme {}` blocks; there is no `tailwind.config.ts`. The pattern: declare design tokens as plain `:root` vars (`--bg: #0e1116`), then in a sibling `@theme inline { --color-bg: var(--bg); }` block republish them as `--color-X` names. The `inline` keyword keeps values as `var()` references so `[data-theme="light"]` overrides flip at runtime. Result: `bg-bg`, `text-text-3`, `border-border-2`, `accent` etc. utility classes work alongside Tailwind defaults (`bg-neutral-900` still resolves until swept). When the plan / spec references `tailwind.config.ts` it's stale — do the v4 translation in CSS.

#### jsdom in this project doesn't expose Web Storage or matchMedia

`window.localStorage` and `window.matchMedia` are both undefined in jsdom v25 as configured here. Test-setup.ts (`src/test-setup.ts`) has stubs for both alongside the existing ResizeObserver / PointerEvent / scrollIntoView stubs. The `afterEach(() => localStorage.clear())` is what prevents per-component persistence from leaking across tests. If a new feature reaches for `window.X` and jsdom doesn't have it, add the stub to that file matching the existing pattern.

#### Popover dropdowns need OccludingPopover, not stock Radix Popover.Content

The viewport popup is FD9b's layered window with software alpha-stamp cut-outs at chrome occlusion rects. A stock Radix `Popover.Content` would render *behind* the engine viewport because the host doesn't know to punch an alpha cut at its rect. Use `OccludingPopover` (in `src/components/OccludingPopover.tsx`) — same `(bridge, occlusionId)` props as `OccludingMenubarContent`, with 24px padding + smoothstep feather to enclose the shadow-xl drop shadow.

#### Multi-channel curve overlay + focus channel = one SVG branch

When the user picked "hybrid focus-channel" for the curve editor restore, the natural-looking decomposition (multi-channel `MultiChannelCurves` for visualisation + single-channel `CurveEditor` for editing, layered) would have doubled the grid / axis / backdrop nodes and complicated pointer routing. The chosen shape is one SVG with a focus-aware render branch: each `<g data-testid="curve-layer-${id}">` renders either focus-styled (thick + opaque + key markers + pointer-events: auto) or background-styled (thin + dim + no markers + pointer-events: none). Single pointer-capture owner, single backdrop, single test-stable layer-per-channel selector.

#### Phase 2.1's per-component useState → Phase 2.4's Zustand store

When a piece of state needs to be shared across a toolbar button, a workspace grid, a panel header X-close, a menu item, and a keyboard shortcut, the per-component `useState` placeholder you wrote in an early sub-task should upgrade to a Zustand store as soon as the second consumer comes online. The pattern in `lib/spawner-visibility.ts`: store with persisted-to-localStorage `visible: boolean` + `toggle()` + `setVisible(v)` + a `__resetForTests` reset, plus a `useSpawnerVisibility()` compat shim returning `{visible, toggle}` so the older callsite keeps working without restructure.

#### Plan re-write before code, not during

The original Phase 1 plan referenced Tailwind v3 + `tailwind.config.ts` + `src/index.css`. Spotting this at the start of execution forced a stop-and-reconsider. The fix was a docs-only commit rewriting Phase 1 in place (with a "Re-plan note" at the top explaining the v3 → v4 translation) **before** any implementation code landed. Diff stays readable; future readers see the rewrite as its own commit with a clear motivation. Alternative ("substitute Tailwind v4 syntax on-the-fly while implementing") would have left the plan stale and the diffs hard to follow.

## Pre-flight checklist for next session

Run these in order before touching code:

```bash
# 1. Confirm worktree is current. (The path may be different — the
#    desktop app provisions a fresh worktree each session.)
cd "/c/Modding/Particle Editor/.claude/worktrees/$WORKTREE_NAME"
git worktree list
git log --oneline -5    # HEAD should be this P8 docs commit on the FF'd `lt-4`
git status              # clean
git log --oneline lt-4..HEAD   # 0 if session branched cleanly from lt-4
git log --oneline HEAD..lt-4   # 0 if session has all the lt-4 work

# 2. Restore NuGet (ONLY needed on a fresh worktree — see header note).
"/c/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/18/Community/MSBuild/Current/Bin/MSBuild.exe" \
  "ParticleEditor.sln" //t:Restore //v:m

# 3. Confirm builds and tests are still green.
"/c/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/18/Community/MSBuild/Current/Bin/MSBuild.exe" \
  "ParticleEditor.sln" //p:Configuration=Debug //p:Platform=x64 //v:m 2>&1 | tail -10
cd web/apps/editor
pnpm install     # may re-inject the allowBuilds block — see L-005
pnpm build       # 0 errors expected
pnpm test        # 277/277 expected
pnpm test:native # 83/83 expected
```

If anything regressed (no known failing specs at session end), the most likely culprits in order:

- pnpm-workspace.yaml `allowBuilds:` block malformed (L-005 — edit yaml, set per-package to `true`).
- WebView2 runtime unavailable (Edge dependency on the host machine).
- node_modules out of sync — re-run `pnpm install`.

## Recommended next moves

0. **Execute B1.4 — Resizable splitters via `react-resizable-panels`** (NEXT DISPATCH). Make the left / centre / right column boundaries draggable so users can size the panes to taste, including the tree/tabs split inside the left column. Persistence to `localStorage` like the theme toggle; defaults match B1.3.1's 25/75 inner split and the existing fixed-width column sizes. No bridge schema, no C++. Standard CLAUDE.md plan structure expected.
2. **Audit B2 — Appearance + Physics tab wiring.** B1.3 wired both tabs through the restructure; B2 may be largely obsolete. A quick diff of the current Appearance + Physics implementations against B2's original target spec should resolve the entire item before re-scoping.
3. **MT-1 follow-up — Texture picker "..." buttons.** Legacy `IDC_BUTTON1` / `IDC_BUTTON2` at `src/ParticleEditor.en.rc:387-389` still unimplemented in the new UI. `TODO(MT-1)` comment marker in `EmitterPropertyTabs.tsx`. Worth filing as a separate dispatch once B1.3.1 / B1.4 ship.
4. **Execute Phase 3** (Tasks 3.1–3.6). Mostly mechanical (dialog re-skins + a sweep + a Playwright spec). Should fit in one session. **Remember to translate Phase 3 plan references to `tailwind.config.ts` to the v4 CSS-first equivalent before dispatching.** Can run in parallel with B1.3.1 / B1.4 if helpful.
5. **Phase 4.2 cutover** comes after Phase 3 ships and the user signs off on parity acceptance (`tasks/lt4_phase_4_1_acceptance.md` §17).
6. **ROADMAP follow-ups from B1 (NT-5, NT-6).** Engine-side single-member link-group enforcement (NT-5) and the visual-stability lane assignment option (NT-6). Both small. NT-6 only worth doing if the bouncing-gutter turns out to be a real ergonomic issue in daily use.
7. **Organic find-and-fix runs continue to be high-yield.** Visual issues discovered during the user's daily use of the build fold cleanly into small fix commits on `lt-4`. This session's two polish rounds (`3ae940e` + `82917f0`) are the latest example of the shape.
8. **(Watch-list)** If the `abort()` dialog the user observed pre-2026-05-20 resurfaces during a Playwright run, capture the assertion text immediately — it was *not* the same bug as `:192` (engine resource-leak fixed in `92ed1db`), so it's still unknown what fires it.

## Conversation context the new session needs

### What the user prefers

- **Iterative cycles with visual verification at each phase boundary.** This session shipped P1 → P8 with a smoke-test pass after P7 surfacing five issues the user then folded into two polish commits. The "let's continue" handoff cadence works well.
- **Source-resolve fact questions before brainstorm.** B1.3's five open questions were resolved by source-reading the legacy `.rc` + `Emitter.cpp` directly rather than entering brainstorm with "needs decision" markers. The user appreciated that brainstorm ran in a single confirmation pass rather than a Q-and-A.
- **Two-stage review on multi-tab dispatches catches real issues.** P3 (a11y) and P6 (weather-disable cascade) each needed a fix commit after the implementer's first pass — both caught only because the dispatch protocol called for code review after each phase. Bake into multi-step plans.
- **Bundled correctness fixes are welcome when discovered during prep.** The `displayInvertedPercent` math was a pre-existing bug surfaced while reading legacy source for Q2; bundling it into B1.3 (rather than filing a separate dispatch) was the right call.
- **CHANGELOG entries are detailed.** Three sections per entry (what ships / how we tackled it / issues encountered), per CLAUDE.md. The B1, B1.2, B1.3 entries set the bar — long, conversational, name files + commits + sub-decisions.

### What the user did NOT delegate

- **Push to `origin/lt-4`** — needs explicit OK each time. This docs commit + the FF have been authorized via "let's handover for a new session".
- **Phase advances** — each phase boundary is a check-in moment.
- **Major lossiness decisions** (Task 2.6's TrackEditor deletion). The user catches these and forces alternatives.

### Technical surface the user cares about

- **The `--legacy-ui` path stays clean.** Zero regression. Verified each cycle.
- **Test counts go up where coverage is meaningful.** Phase 1: 191 → 195. Phase 2: 195 → 200. Phase 2.8: 200 → 219. Don't drop counts without explicit reason.
- **The known failing native spec is documented in HANDOFF + CHANGELOG and tracked, not hidden.**
- **No silent failures.** Items not yet implemented log a TODO marker, not a silent no-op.
