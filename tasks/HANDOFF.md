# Session Handoff — AloParticleEditor / LT-4 UI overhaul (post-D5)

**Last updated:** 2026-05-19 (post-D5 dispatch)
**Last conversation context:** Resumed in a fresh worktree (`awesome-morse-5ea5c3`) on the same commit lineage as the prior session's `goofy-shtern-ded61e`. Ran the pre-flight, surfaced the desktop-app auto-worktree behaviour as a separate workflow issue (no fix attempted), then shipped **D5** — texture-aware `file/open` for skydome + ground custom slots. The previous session had focused on FD9b / FD10 Group A / FD10 Group D + organic find-and-fix runs; see the post-FD10 section below and CHANGELOG entries for that detail.

## Read first

If you are a fresh Claude session resuming this project:

1. **This file** — top to bottom.
2. **[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)** — project conventions, plan structure, handoff discipline.
3. **[tasks/lessons.md](lessons.md)** — L-001 through L-006. **Read L-002, L-003, L-004, L-006 carefully before any test/build/optimistic-state work.**
4. **[tasks/lt4_phase_4_1_acceptance.md](lt4_phase_4_1_acceptance.md)** — parity acceptance checklist. Section 16 lists intentional divergences from legacy.
5. **[CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md)** — top two entries are FD9b (layered viewport) and FD10 (Group A + Group D). Read them to understand the current architecture.
6. Recent `git log --oneline -30` — 25 commits in this session, all in the LT-4 Phase 4.1 polish line.

## Resumable state (snapshot)

| Thing | Value |
|---|---|
| **Worktree** | `C:\Modding\Particle Editor\.claude\worktrees\awesome-morse-5ea5c3` |
| **Branch** | `claude/awesome-morse-5ea5c3` |
| **HEAD** | unknown until D5 commit lands — check `git log --oneline -1` |
| **Working tree** | clean post-commit |
| **Behind master** | check `git log --oneline master..HEAD` (master was `b28f624` at start of D5 session) |
| **Open PRs** | none |
| **Build status** | MSBuild Debug x64 clean (LIBCMTD warning is preexisting). Vitest **191/191**. Playwright **80/80**. |
| **Phase status** | Phase 4.1 — FD9b, FD10 Group A, FD10 Group D, D5, and D6 shipped + several follow-ups. All "make a stub work" items closed. |

**Worktree note.** The Claude Code desktop app provisions a fresh worktree on every session start; this session inherited `awesome-morse-5ea5c3` from the harness, replacing the previous `goofy-shtern-ded61e` (now pruned). Branch name follows the worktree name. The commit lineage is preserved — only the path / branch label change. If you want to resume in a specific worktree directory rather than getting a fresh one each time, the CLI workflow `claude --continue` from inside the desired worktree path is the only way today (the desktop app has no equivalent setting). Documented in the conversation log for the D5 session.

**NuGet pre-flight (fresh worktrees only).** `.gitignore` excludes `packages/`, so the first MSBuild in a fresh worktree fails with *"missing Microsoft.Web.WebView2.targets"*. Restore explicitly before the first build:

```bash
"/c/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/18/Community/MSBuild/Current/Bin/MSBuild.exe" \
  "ParticleEditor.sln" //t:Restore //v:m
```

Then the standard Debug x64 build works. Skip this step on a worktree that's already been built in once.

## What landed in this session (25 commits)

### FD9b — Layered viewport with software alpha-stamp cut-outs (15 commits)

Replaced the FD7/FD8 `SetWindowRgn` HRGN-based cut-out plumbing with `WS_EX_LAYERED` + `UpdateLayeredWindow(ULW_ALPHA)`. The viewport popup is now a layered window; engine renders to an off-screen `D3DFMT_A8R8G8B8` RT; per-frame readback + alpha-stamping at chrome occlusion rects + UpdateLayeredWindow push.

T1–T8 land the architecture. T9 + four post-T9 follow-ups fix gnarly issues uncovered during the visual gate:
- `D3DPOOL_DEFAULT` lifetime vs `m_pDevice->Reset` (compositor RT must release before reset).
- MSAA depth restore onto MS_NONE compositor RT silently dropped the distort quad → solid-black viewport.
- Smoothstep feather initially carved the menu's own outline → fix landed alongside per-occlusion pad+feather via bridge schema extension.
- Clipped-edge feather logic re-computed from the ORIGINAL rect, not the clipped bounds, to fix asymmetric purple-halo on near-popup-edge menus.

Full architectural prose in `CHANGELOG.md` under the FD9b entry.

### FD10 Group A — EmitterTree panel toolbar + 3D cursor in status bar (1 commit)

Restored the legacy `EmitterList` panel toolbar: `[New ▾] [Delete] [▲][▼] [👁] [Show All] [Hide All]`. New bridge requests `emitters/set-visible` + `emitters/set-all-visible`. Status bar gains a 5th column for the 3D ground-plane intersection of the viewport mouse cursor, throttled to ~30 Hz host-side.

### FD10 Group D — Close out disabled-stub menu items (1 commit + follow-ups)

Four items became real:
- **File → Exit** — new `app/quit` bridge request → host `PostMessage(WM_CLOSE)`. Reuses the dirty-prompt path.
- **View → Reset Camera** — one-line dispatch with legacy default vectors via existing `engine/set/camera`.
- **View → Reset View Settings** — new `engine/action/reset-view-settings` cascades 9 engine setters in one host action; React shows a Modal confirm.
- **Lighting → Force Align Fill Lights** — restored checkbox with sun-az → fill-az cascade. Constants from `main.cpp:6238-6240`.

### FD10 organic finds (8 commits)

Surfaced during normal use of the FD10-shipped build:
- ContextMenu on EmitterTree rows needed the same occlusion registration the menubar uses (clipping at the viewport popup edge).
- FPS counter swung 0/1024 because `FPSMeasurer` used `GetTickCount` — fine for vsync'd legacy, useless on FD9b's uncapped UpdateLayeredWindow path. Switched to `QueryPerformanceCounter`.
- Insert-mode key insertion left Time/Value spinners stuck at 0 — fixed with sticky optimistic override (L-006), proper SVG-onClick guard in Insert mode, and explicit-clear-on-selection-change.
- Right-click on empty curve canvas now drops back to Select mode (legacy-style escape gesture).
- Right-click on a curve key opens a small floating menu with Delete (disabled for border keys).
- Viewport popup's window class was missing `hCursor = IDC_ARROW` — main HWND's resize-edge cursor was leaking into the viewport.
- L-006 captured in `tasks/lessons.md`: "Don't clear React optimistic state on every host-data refresh" (this pattern bit us three times across FD9b and FD10).
- Force Align toggle now persists to `localStorage` (key `alo:lighting:force-align`). Full registry parity with legacy `LightingForceFillAlignment` REG_DWORD is deferred.

---

## What landed in this session (D5 + D6)

**D5 — Texture-aware `file/open` for skydome + ground custom slots.** Replaces the hardcoded `*.alo` filter on the Background and Ground Texture custom-slot pickers with `*.dds;*.tga`. Skydome slots 9/10/11 used to silently misfilter; ground texture slots 5/6/7 were genuine no-ops. Both surfaces now work. See CHANGELOG entry "Texture-aware `file/open` for skydome + ground custom slots (D5)".

**D6 — Mods menu detection + selection.** Two commits. Step 1 (`ea0ed40`) extracted `ModManager` from `src/main.cpp` into `src/ModManager.{h,cpp}` — single source of truth for mod discovery + active-mod state, shared between legacy and new-UI. Behaviour-preserving refactor with zero functional change. Step 2 added the `mods/list` / `mods/select` / `mods/refresh` bridge surface, the `activeModPath` DTO field, MockBridge stubs, and a full React MenuBar rewrite replacing the `(none)` placeholder. Cross-mode persistence via the existing `HKCU\Software\AloParticleEditor\LastMod` registry key — both UI modes read/write the same key and agree on the active mod across restarts. See CHANGELOG entry "Mods menu detection + selection (D6)" for the full design.

This closes out **all four "make a stub work" items** from FD10 Group D (D1 Exit, D2 Reset Camera, D3 Reset View Settings, D4 Force Align in earlier dispatch; D5 + D6 in this session).

## What's left

### Phase 4.1 acceptance items still deferred

None of the "make a stub work" items remain. The remaining LT-4 work is documented divergences from legacy (Group B / Group C) and Phase 4.2 cutover.

### Larger Group B / C work (design conversation first)

These are documented divergences from legacy that the user flagged as "the new UI diverges too heavily" — Group A and Group D were the agreed first waves. Whether to keep, partially restore, or fully revert each is a judgment call. From `[tasks/lt4_phase_4_1_acceptance.md §16]`:

**Group B — layout-shape divergences**
- Tool panels: legacy = independent modeless windows; new-UI = single mutually-exclusive sliding panel.
- Inline rename (F2/dbl-click) vs legacy's modal input.

**Group C — replaced-with-different**
- Native `ChooseColor` dialog (legacy) → Radix Popover (new) — every `ColorButton` site.
- Drag/drop reparent slot picker (legacy popup) → auto-picks lifetime (new).
- Multi-lane bracket rendering → single-lane (new).

### Phase 4.2 cutover (4 tasks, gated on parity)

- 4.1 Hybrid-vs-legacy parity acceptance run — partial (Group A + D done, B/C unaddressed)
- 4.2 Delete legacy chrome (`src/UI/`, legacy `main.cpp` paths) — gated on §17 GO
- 4.3 ROADMAP + CHANGELOG ship entry (LT-4 → §5 Shipped, renumber per CLAUDE.md tier-tag rules)
- 4.4 Release zip update (bundle `MicrosoftEdgeWebview2Setup.exe` + `web/apps/editor/dist/`)

### Recommended next moves

1. **Triage Groups B/C with the user before touching either.** They're not bugs — they're design decisions Claude made and the user might or might not agree with. The Group A "tackle this first" pattern worked because the user explicitly listed Group A's items as parity gaps; Groups B/C need the same user-driven prioritization. This is now the highest-leverage open item.
2. **Phase 4.2 cutover** — delete legacy chrome, ROADMAP + CHANGELOG ship entry, release zip update. Gated on the user signing off on parity acceptance (§17 of `tasks/lt4_phase_4_1_acceptance.md` is still empty).
3. **Organic find-and-fix runs continue to be high-yield.** The most important fixes from prior sessions (FPS counter using QPC instead of GetTickCount, cursor inheritance on the viewport popup) came from "play with the editor and report what looks off" prompts, not from any tracked plan item.

---

## Hard-won lessons (preserve!)

All in `tasks/lessons.md`. **Read L-002, L-003, L-004, L-006 carefully before any test or schema or optimistic-state work.**

- **L-001** — Don't infer binary provenance from bitness + timestamp alone (Petroglyph 64-bit patch incident).
- **L-002** — Repo-root `.gitignore` `**/packages/*` eats `web/packages/*` source; use scoped negation.
- **L-003** — WebView2 silently drops `chrome.webview.postMessage` after CDP attachment. Playwright contract tests route through `chrome.webview.hostObjects.hostBridge` instead.
- **L-004** — `pnpm test` (Vitest) doesn't type-check. `tsc --noEmit` (single-project) ≠ `tsc -b` (build mode with project references). Truth is `pnpm build`. Verification sequence: `pnpm build` → `pnpm test` → `pnpm test:native`.
- **L-005** — pnpm v11 `allowBuilds:` block wants a boolean, not the literal placeholder string. Edit the workspace yaml directly; the interactive approve-builds TUI doesn't work via piped stdin.
- **L-006** — *NEW.* Don't clear React optimistic state on every host-data refresh. Use sticky overrides cleared only on explicit user-action selection-change.

### Pattern-level things worth knowing

#### The recurring optimistic-state pattern (see L-006)

This bit us THREE times in subtly different surfaces:
- FD9b LayoutBroker re-emitting occlusion rects when the popup moves (rather than letting the React rect arrive stale).
- FD10 TrackEditor Time/Value optimistic override.
- FD10 sticky-selection after Insert-mode key add (which exposed a fourth-cause: the SVG-container onClick firing on click events whose `e.target === e.currentTarget` resolved to the SVG itself when down-target and up-target differed).

If you see "the boxes/state flashes correct then reverts to a stale default after an async mutation," the override is being cleared too aggressively. L-006 has the durable pattern.

#### FPS measurement on uncapped frame rates

`GetTickCount()` is ~15.6 ms resolution. Fine for vsync'd legacy (~60 FPS) but useless on FD9b's `UpdateLayeredWindow` path (200-500 FPS uncapped). Use `QueryPerformanceCounter` for any sub-millisecond timing. The `FPSMeasurer` in `src/host/HostWindow.cpp` is now QPC; the legacy editor's `src/main.cpp:56-99` still uses GetTickCount — fine because legacy is vsync'd, but if anyone ever extends legacy's render path the same fix applies.

#### Win32 cursor inheritance

Top-level window classes need an explicit `hCursor` in their WNDCLASSEXW. Without one, the previous window's cursor (e.g., the main HWND's resize-edge cursor) leaks into the new window's client area. The viewport popup's class was missing this for a long time — the fix is one line: `vc.hCursor = LoadCursor(nullptr, IDC_ARROW)`.

#### Compositor RT lifetime around D3D9 device reset

Any `D3DPOOL_DEFAULT` resource (RT, vertex buffer, texture) must be released BEFORE `IDirect3DDevice9::Reset` or the call returns `D3DERR_INVALIDCALL`. The compositor's off-screen RT is POOL_DEFAULT (it has to be — POOL_MANAGED can't be RT). FD9b's `AlphaCompositor::ReleaseGpuResources` is wired into `Engine::Reset` just after the shader OnLostDevice block. Don't add new POOL_DEFAULT resources without thinking about their Reset story.

#### MS multisample matching for RT + depth pair

D3D9 requires the bound RT and depth-stencil surface to have matching multisample type/quality. The engine's auto-depth-stencil is multisampled (highest type the device supports, picked by `GetMultiSampleType`). The compositor's RT is `D3DMULTISAMPLE_NONE` (`GetRenderTargetData` can't read multisampled surfaces). In FD9b mode, `Engine::Render` skips restoring the auto-depth at the end — it keeps `m_pDepthStencilSurface` (also MS_NONE) bound, which is MS-compatible with the compositor RT. The legacy Present path still restores the auto-depth.

#### Production dist must be rebuilt after React edits

`ParticleEditor.exe --new-ui` (without `--dev-ui`) navigates to `https://app.local/index.html` which maps to `web/apps/editor/dist/`. Edits to React source don't reach the binary until you re-run `pnpm --filter @particle-editor/editor build`. Always rebuild dist before `test:native`.

#### Test launch order matters (Playwright)

Playwright runs specs alphabetically and shares a browser context across tests within a file. Be careful with state restoration in earlier specs — `View > Bloom` flips state but restores it; if you forget the restore, later specs break opaquely. This bit us in FD9b T9 — three specs (skydome-slot, ground-texture, spawner/active-count) appeared to fail in a related cluster, all because the compositor RT lifetime bug broke device reset, leaving the engine in a half-initialized state.

## Conversation context the new session needs

### What the user prefers (delegation pattern)

- **Design decisions** — the user delegates most design calls. The Background picker, App shell, Toolbar, Main menu, AlphaCompositor pad/feather defaults, and Modal vs AlertDialog all had their design made by Claude with "push back if wrong" framing. The user occasionally redirects (FD9 plan → FD9b pivot), so make conservative legacy-mimicking calls and document them.
- **Pacing** — short, iterative cycles. One dispatch → relaunch → user verifies visually → next dispatch. Multi-dispatch batches (like FD10 Group A) work but the user appreciates being able to inspect intermediate state.
- **Legacy parity is the rule.** The user explicitly flagged "the UI diverges too heavily" mid-session and we course-corrected to Group A. When in doubt about a design call, match legacy.
- **Visual verification** — the user runs the editor and reports what looks off. The `request_access` flow for screenshots is unreliable in this environment (cached bundleId from a previous worktree intercepts). Don't depend on screenshots; rely on the user's eyes.
- **Verification rigor** — vitest count + native count are the hard floor. 183/183 + 77/77 is the current bar. Don't ship work that drops the count.

### What the user did NOT delegate

- **Architecture pivots** — the FD9 → FD9b call was the user explicitly picking option 3 (software alpha-stamp) after Claude flagged that the original plan had a load-bearing logic gap. New cross-cutting calls need explicit OK.
- **Phase boundaries** — Phase 4.2 (delete legacy) is gated on the user signing off on parity acceptance. Don't auto-advance.

### Technical surface the user cares about

- **The `--legacy-ui` path stays clean.** Zero regression. Verified each cycle.
- **Test counts go up** every dispatch where coverage is meaningful. Vitest 180 → 183 (+3 from FD9b + Force Align spec). Native 76 → 77 (one new spec).
- **No silent failures.** Items not yet implemented log a TODO, not a silent no-op. Disabled stubs (Reset Camera was the canonical example before D2) are explicit `disabled` props with TODO comments — not invisible.

## Pre-flight checklist for next session

Run these in order before touching code:

```bash
# 1. Confirm worktree is current. (The path may be different — the
#    desktop app provisions a fresh worktree each session.)
cd "/c/Modding/Particle Editor/.claude/worktrees/$WORKTREE_NAME"
git worktree list
git log --oneline -5    # HEAD should be the latest D5 / FD10 commit
git status              # clean

# 2. Restore NuGet (ONLY needed on a fresh worktree — see header note).
"/c/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/18/Community/MSBuild/Current/Bin/MSBuild.exe" \
  "ParticleEditor.sln" //t:Restore //v:m

# 3. Confirm builds and tests are still green.
"/c/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/18/Community/MSBuild/Current/Bin/MSBuild.exe" \
  "ParticleEditor.sln" //p:Configuration=Debug //p:Platform=x64 //v:m 2>&1 | tail -10
cd web/apps/editor
pnpm install     # may re-inject the allowBuilds block — see L-005
pnpm build       # 0 errors expected
pnpm test        # 188/188 expected
pnpm test:native # 77/77 expected
```

If anything regressed, the most likely culprits in order:
- pnpm-workspace.yaml `allowBuilds:` block malformed (L-005 — edit yaml, set per-package to `true`).
- A worktree confusion — `request_access` and similar tools may cache a path from `laughing-tereshkova-32e22a` (the other parallel worktree). Verify the running PID's exe path matches `goofy-shtern-ded61e`.
- WebView2 runtime unavailable (Edge dependency on the host machine).
- node_modules out of sync — re-run `pnpm install`.

---

## Open questions / deferrals (do *not* silently address)

(D5 + D6 both shipped this session. Force Align registry persistence remains noted in the FD10 entry; the per-key context-menu future entries are still natural follow-ups but no one's asked.)
- **Group B / C divergences** — see "What's left" above. Each is a design conversation before code.
- **Force Align registry persistence.** Currently `localStorage` only — doesn't sync with legacy `LightingForceFillAlignment` REG_DWORD. Cross-mode persistence needs a host registry helper + new bridge kind.
- **Per-key context menu future entries.** Only Delete is wired. Snap-to-grid / Reset value / etc. are natural follow-ups but no one's asked for them yet.
- **Phase 4.1 acceptance final pass.** The doc's §17 "Findings summary" is still empty. A full walkthrough comparing legacy vs new-UI side-by-side would close it out.
